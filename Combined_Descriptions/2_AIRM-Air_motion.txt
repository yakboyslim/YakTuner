## Function
This Simulink diagram illustrates a control system, likely for an automotive "Air Intake Regulation Module" (AIRM) specifically managing "Port Flap Variables." Its primary function is to process various input signals (including sensor readings, acknowledgements, permissions, and internal states) at a regular 10ms interval, perform necessary initialization, and then generate output signals that represent commanded states, actual values, setpoints, and fault statuses related to the port flaps. The system incorporates a feedback mechanism, suggesting a closed-loop control or state management logic.

## Inputs
The system receives the following key inputs:

*   **`<V_PORT_1>`:** Likely a status or command signal for port 1.
*   **`<V_PORT_2>`:** Likely a status or command signal for port 2.
*   **`<V_PORT_NR>`:** Represents the number or nominal rate of a port.
*   **`<V_PORT_AD_OPEN>`:** Acknowledgment or status indicating a port is commanded or detected as open.
*   **`<V_PORT_AD_CLOSE>`:** Acknowledgment or status indicating a port is commanded or detected as closed.
*   **`<NC_PORT_NR>`:** Another port number or nominal rate, possibly from a different source or for a specific configuration.
*   **`<NC_FID_PORT_FB_EL>`:** Feedback signal, likely electrical, related to port position or status.
*   **`<ACTION_FARM_GetPermission_T3>`:** A permission or enable signal from an external function or module.
*   **`<LV_PORT_DEAC>`:** A local variable or command for port deactivation.
*   **`fc_INI`:** Initialization trigger signal.
*   **`RST`:** Reset signal.
*   **`fc_OPM`:** Operational signal, indicating the system's active state.

## Outputs
The system produces the following key outputs:

*   **`<FAC_PORT_DEAC>`:** Fault Accumulator for Port Deactivation (indicates a fault related to flap deactivation).
*   **`<FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV>`:** Fault Accumulator for Port Deactivation Moving Value (a dynamic fault indicator).
*   **`<STATE_EL_FAC_MVB_PORT>`:** Electrical State of Fault Accumulator for Motor Variable Bank Port (detailed electrical fault status).
*   **`<STATE_EL_MVB_PORT>`:** Electrical State of Motor Variable Bank Port (current electrical state of the flap motor/mechanism).
*   **`<STATE_MVB_PORT_AV>`:** Actual Value of Motor Variable Bank Port State (current physical position or state of the port flap).
*   **`<STATE_MVB_PORT_SP>`:** Setpoint of Motor Variable Bank Port State (the target physical position or state for the port flap).

## Logic Flow
The logical flow of the system can be described step-by-step:

1.  **Overall Module (APP_CDN V.5.14):** This block acts as the wrapper for the entire system, defining its execution characteristics. It is scheduled to run with a `Recurrence` of `10MS`. It's `always` activated and `never` deactivated, implying continuous operation once initialized.
    *   It receives external scheduling signals (`fc_INI`, `RST`, `fc_OPM`) and provides the context for the internal subsystems.

2.  **Initialization Subsystem (INI X.1):**
    *   Upon receiving the `fc_INI` signal (and potentially `RST`), this block executes the system's initialization logic.
    *   The associated text "The variables are initialized at LV_IGK = 0 --> 1" suggests specific variable initializations occur here or are triggered by this block.
    *   Once initialized, it outputs an `ini` signal, which is fed into the main operational block. This ensures that the operational logic only begins or proceeds after proper initialization.

3.  **Input Aggregation:** All the external sensor readings, acknowledgements, and command inputs (e.g., `<V_PORT_1>`, `<ACTION_FARM_GetPermission_T3>`) are collected and fed as a single aggregated `<input>` into the `OPM_10MS X.2` block.

4.  **Operational Subsystem (OPM_10MS X.2):** This is the core control logic block, executing cyclically every 10ms.
    *   It receives the `fc_OPM` signal (indicating operational mode), the `ini` status from the initialization block, and the aggregated `<input>` signals.
    *   Crucially, it also receives a `<feedback>` signal from the `V.6.4` block, which likely contains information about the system's current state, measured values, or diagnostic data from the previous cycle.
    *   Based on all these inputs, this block computes the necessary internal states, commands, and intermediate results for controlling the port flaps.

5.  **Output and Feedback Processing (V.6.4):**
    *   The internal outputs from `OPM_10MS X.2` are routed to the `V.6.4` block. This block likely performs final processing, filtering, or mapping of the computed states into the specific output formats required by other systems or actuators.
    *   It generates all the external output signals (e.g., `<FAC_PORT_DEAC>`, `<STATE_MVB_PORT_SP>`) that provide status, fault information, and control setpoints for the port flap mechanisms.
    *   Simultaneously, `V.6.4` generates the `<feedback>` signal, which is looped back to the `OPM_10MS X.2` block. This feedback closes the control loop, allowing the operational logic to adapt its calculations in the next 10ms cycle based on the current state and results.

This establishes a continuous, real-time control cycle where initialization prepares the system, and subsequent 10ms operational cycles read inputs, process logic with feedback, and produce outputs to manage the port flap variables.

The provided image contains two block diagrams that are characteristic of Simulink or similar block-diagram modeling environments used in automotive systems engineering. I will analyze both diagrams as they appear to be related to the calculation of port flap deactivation.

---

## Function

The primary function of these diagrams is to calculate and filter a **Port Deactivation Factor** (`FAC_PORT_DEAC` and its filtered mean `FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV`).

**Diagram 1 (Figure 2.2.4: Calculation of FAC_PORT_DEAC):** This diagram calculates a raw Port Deactivation Factor (`FAC_PORT_DEAC`). It incorporates hysteresis logic based on the actual port state (`V_PORT_IS`) relative to open and close setpoints, and includes an error handling mechanism (`lv_err_port_tmp`) that can force the deactivation factor to zero.

**Diagram 2 (Figure 2.2.5: Calculation of FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV):** This diagram takes the `FAC_PORT_DEAC` value, applies a conditional selection (potentially for non-filtered ports), and then processes it through mean value calculation and filtering stages to produce a smoothed output `FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV`.

---

## Inputs

**For Diagram 1 (Calculation of FAC_PORT_DEAC):**

*   **`<LV_PORT_DEAC>`**: Current or previous port deactivation status/value.
*   **`lv_err_port_tmp`**: A temporary error flag or value for the port (e.g., 0 for no error, 1 for error).
*   **`<V_PORT_IS>`**: The actual or measured state/position of the port (e.g., a sensor reading).
*   **`<V_PORT_AD_OPEN>`**: An adjusted setpoint or threshold for considering the port in an "open" state.
*   **`C_V_PORT_TOL_HYS`**: A constant representing the hysteresis tolerance for the port feedback at the bottom limit (related to opening).
*   **`<V_PORT_AD_CLOSE>`**: An adjusted setpoint or threshold for considering the port in a "closed" state.
*   **`C_V_PORT_BOL_HYS`**: A constant representing the hysteresis tolerance for the port feedback at the top limit (related to closing).

**For Diagram 2 (Calculation of FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV):**

*   **`<FAC_PORT_DEAC>`**: The raw Port Deactivation Factor calculated by Diagram 1.
*   **`<NO_PORT_NF>`**: A flag (e.g., boolean) indicating a condition related to non-filtered ports.
*   **`C_CRLC_FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV`**: A constant parameter used in the mean value calculation.

---

## Outputs

*   **`<FAC_PORT_DEAC>`**: The calculated raw Port Deactivation Factor.

**For Diagram 2 (Calculation of FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV):**

*   **`<FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV>`**: The filtered mean Port Deactivation Factor.

## Logic Flow

### Diagram 1: Calculation of FAC_PORT_DEAC

1.  **Error-Condition Override:**
    *   The `lv_err_port_tmp` signal is compared with `0`.
    *   A rightmost switch (`Check ~= 0 V.6.4`) determines the final `FAC_PORT_DEAC`.
    *   If `lv_err_port_tmp` is **not equal to 0** (i.e., an error is present), the switch selects `0`, effectively forcing `FAC_PORT_DEAC` to zero, overriding other calculations.
    *   If `lv_err_port_tmp` is **equal to 0** (no error), the switch selects the output of the complex hysteresis logic (described below).

2.  **Hysteresis Logic (executed when no error is present):**
    *   **Port Open Hysteresis:**
        *   An `open_threshold` is calculated by summing `<V_PORT_AD_OPEN>` and `C_V_PORT_TOL_HYS`.
        *   The actual port state `<V_PORT_IS>` is compared to this `open_threshold` using a `>` operator.
        *   A switch (top `V.6.0`) outputs `0.99998` (likely representing "almost fully open" or "active") if `<V_PORT_IS>` is greater than the `open_threshold`, otherwise it outputs `0`. Let's call this `val_open`.
    *   **Port Close Hysteresis:**
        *   A `close_threshold` is calculated by summing `<V_PORT_AD_CLOSE>` and `C_V_PORT_BOL_HYS`.
        *   The actual port state `<V_PORT_IS>` is compared to this `close_threshold` using a `<` operator.
        *   A switch (bottom `V.6.0`) outputs `0.99998` if `<V_PORT_IS>` is less than the `close_threshold`, otherwise it outputs `0`. Let's call this `val_close_raw`.
        *   `val_close_raw` then passes through a block `V.6.8` (symbol `/`, likely a gain or inverse operation). Let's call this `val_close_scaled`.
        *   `val_close_scaled` is then summed with a constant `0.99998` ("default value for closed PORT1"). Let's call this `val_close_final`.
    *   **Combining Hysteresis Outputs:**
        *   Another switch (`Check ~= 0 V.6.2`) takes the result of the `V_PORT_IS < close_threshold` comparison as its control input.
        *   If `V_PORT_IS < close_threshold` is true, it selects `val_close_final`.
        *   If `V_PORT_IS < close_threshold` is false, it selects `val_open`.
        *   The output of this switch, along with `LV_PORT_DEAC` (which seems to be bypassed by the hysteresis logic as `LV_PORT_DEAC` is passed through by the `lv_err_port_tmp` check), forms the input to the main error-condition switch when `lv_err_port_tmp == 0`. The exact merge logic here is visually ambiguous but typically implies a priority or a further conditional selection if `LV_PORT_DEAC` is distinct from the hysteresis result. Given the direct line from the `LV_PORT_DEAC` input through the `lv_err_port_tmp` switch, and then into the final `Check ~= 0` switch *as one of its selectable data inputs*, it is most plausible that `LV_PORT_DEAC` is passed through if no error, and the hysteresis logic determines the final `FAC_PORT_DEAC`. The `LV_PORT_DEAC` at the top right of the diagram *is* an input.

        *   **Refined interpretation for no-error path:** When `lv_err_port_tmp == 0`:
            *   The top-right switch selects `LV_PORT_DEAC` (as its `else` input). This `LV_PORT_DEAC` then connects to the final merge.
            *   The hysteresis calculations (the middle and bottom paths) compute their results (`val_open`, `val_close_final`, combined by `Check ~= 0 V.6.2`).
            *   These results all merge. The exact merge logic into `FAC_PORT_DEAC` is still the most ambiguous part of this diagram. A common pattern is that the `LV_PORT_DEAC` serves as a baseline that can be further modified by hysteresis logic, or it's implicitly part of the "setpoint" that the hysteresis logic works around. However, given the structure, the `LV_PORT_DEAC` input is primarily selected when `lv_err_port_tmp == 0` and then possibly further acted upon.

            *   **Most plausible final flow for Diagram 1:**
                1.  Determine `error_state = (lv_err_port_tmp ~= 0)`.
                2.  If `error_state` is true, `FAC_PORT_DEAC = 0`.
                3.  Else (`error_state` is false):
                    *   Calculate `open_threshold = V_PORT_AD_OPEN + C_V_PORT_TOL_HYS`.
                    *   Calculate `close_threshold = V_PORT_AD_CLOSE + C_V_PORT_BOL_HYS`.
                    *   `val_open = (V_PORT_IS > open_threshold) ? 0.99998 : 0`.
                    *   `val_close_raw = (V_PORT_IS < close_threshold) ? 0.99998 : 0`.
                    *   `val_close_scaled = V.6.8(val_close_raw)`.
                    *   `val_close_final = val_close_scaled + 0.99998`.
                    *   `FAC_PORT_DEAC = (V_PORT_IS < close_threshold) ? val_close_final : val_open`.
                    *   This implies `LV_PORT_DEAC` is an initial value for the setpoint logic that gets refined, but its direct connection to the merge is ambiguous if it's not the actual setpoint. For clarity, I will describe the direct calculation based on the visual blocks.

### Diagram 2: Calculation of FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV

1.  **Input Selection:**
    *   A switch selects its input based on the `<NO_PORT_NF>` signal.
    *   If `<NO_PORT_NF>` is active (e.g., true or non-zero), the switch outputs `0`.
    *   If `<NO_PORT_NF>` is inactive (e.g., false or zero), the switch outputs the raw `<FAC_PORT_DEAC>` value.
    *   This implies that under the `NO_PORT_NF` condition, the subsequent mean value and filtering stages are effectively bypassed or reset to zero.

2.  **Mean Value Computation:**
    *   The selected signal from step 1 (either `0` or `FAC_PORT_DEAC`) is fed into a "Calculation of the mean value" block.
    *   This block also takes `C_CRLC_FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV` as an input, which likely provides parameters for how the mean is calculated (e.g., window size, weighting factors).
    *   The output of this block is an intermediate signal, labeled `x_out`.

3.  **Mean Value Filtering:**
    *   The intermediate `x_out` signal is then fed into a "Filtering of the mean value" block.
    *   This block acts as a digital filter. It also receives several constant inputs (`m=1`, `E=0`, `R=0`, `IV=0`, `x_in=0`), suggesting a specific, fixed filter configuration.
    *   The output of this filtering block is the final smoothed output, `<FAC_PORT_DEAC_MV>`.


--- Page 9 ---

This image displays a Simulink (or similar block diagram tool like TargetLink) representation of a control logic for an automotive system, specifically related to the "State of intake manifold" and "Port flap variables."

## Function
The primary function of this diagram is to calculate and output two key states for a manifold variable bypass (MVB) port: a setpoint (`STATE_MVB_PORT_SP`) and an actual value/status (`STATE_MVB_PORT_AV`). These values likely represent the desired and current operational states or positions (e.g., open/closed percentage, or specific state codes) of a flap or valve within the intake manifold system.

## Inputs
1.  **`<LV_PORT_DEAC>`**: (Likely a boolean or flag) Indicates a low voltage condition or a command for port deactivation. This directly influences the setpoint.
2.  **`<NG_PORT_NR>`**: (Likely a boolean or numerical value) Could represent a "Nominal Gear Port Number" or some "Not Good/Not Ready" status related to the port. Its exact meaning depends on the specific system context.
3.  **`<FAC_PORT_DEAC>`**: (Likely a boolean or flag) Represents a "Failsafe Active Condition" for port deactivation or a "Factory" specific deactivation command.

## Outputs
1.  **`STATE_MVB_PORT_SP`**: (Likely an integer or float, e.g., 0-100) The setpoint for the Manifold Variable Bypass Port.
2.  **`STATE_MVB_PORT_AV`**: (Likely an integer or float, e.g., 0-100) The actual value or derived status of the Manifold Variable Bypass Port.

## Logic Flow

The diagram's logic flow can be broken down into two main paths, one for each output:

**Path 1: Determining `STATE_MVB_PORT_SP` (Setpoint)**

1.  **Conditional Check (`cond_if` V.6.0)**: The input signal `<LV_PORT_DEAC>` is fed into a conditional block. This block evaluates whether the condition represented by `<LV_PORT_DEAC>` is true or false.
2.  **Value Assignment (If branch)**: If the condition `<LV_PORT_DEAC>` is true, a constant value of `100` (from block V.6.1) is selected.
3.  **Value Assignment (Else branch)**: If the condition `<LV_PORT_DEAC>` is false, a constant value of `0` (from block V.6.1) is selected.
4.  **Merge**: The selected value (either 100 or 0) from the conditional branches is then passed through a `Merge` block. This block consolidates the conditionally activated signals into a single output signal.
5.  **Output**: The final merged value becomes `STATE_MVB_PORT_SP`.
    *   **Interpretation**: This path dictates that the port's setpoint is either 100 or 0, directly controlled by the `<LV_PORT_DEAC>` status. For example, if `<LV_PORT_DEAC>` is true (port deactivation commanded), the setpoint is 100 (which might represent a "deactivated state" or "fully open/closed safety position"). If `<LV_PORT_DEAC>` is false (port active), the setpoint is 0 (which might represent a "normal operating range" or "fully closed" position).

**Path 2: Determining `STATE_MVB_PORT_AV` (Actual Value/Status)**

1.  **Input Selection/Logic Block (`V.6.9`)**: The inputs `<NG_PORT_NR>` and `<FAC_PORT_DEAC>` are fed into a block labeled `V.6.9` with an icon `[...] C`. This typically represents a Multiport Switch, Selector, or a custom logic block that processes these two inputs to produce a single output based on internal logic or an implied control signal 'C'. This block likely determines an intermediate state or status based on the nominal and failsafe deactivation conditions.
2.  **Scaling/Flagging (`V.7.3`)**: The output from block `V.6.9` is then multiplied (indicated by the 'X' symbol) by a constant value of `100` (from block V.6.1).
3.  **Output**: The result of this multiplication becomes `STATE_MVB_PORT_AV`.
    *   **Interpretation**: This path suggests that the actual status of the port is derived from a combination of `<NG_PORT_NR>` and `<FAC_PORT_DEAC>`. The output of block `V.6.9` is likely a binary (0 or 1) or fractional value which is then scaled to 0 or 100 (or a percentage) to represent the `STATE_MVB_PORT_AV`. For instance, if `V.6.9` outputs 1 when certain conditions are met, `STATE_MVB_PORT_AV` would be 100; otherwise, it would be 0 (or a scaled fractional value).

The image displays a block diagram, characteristic of a Simulink or similar modeling environment used in automotive systems engineering. It provides a functional overview of a specific control logic related to "Port flap position set point actuation signal processing."

## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to calculate and provide the `LV_PORT_DEAC` signal, which represents a deactivation command for a "Port Flap" system. This calculation is executed based on various engine and application conditions, particularly in cases of port flap errors, as stated in the accompanying text. The system operates with a 10ms recurrence and involves initialization, processing of numerous input parameters, and potentially feedback to determine the final deactivation state.

## Inputs

The diagram takes a large number of inputs, mostly originating from the system's environment and feeding into the `APP_CDN V.5.14` block, which then passes processed signals to the `OPM_10MS X.2` block.

**Key Inputs (to `APP_CDN V.5.14`):**
*   `<LV_STP>`: Engine stop-related signal.
*   `<LV_EST>`: Engine start-related signal.

*   `<NC_IDX_CH_0_S>` through `<NC_IDX_CH_2_S>`: A series of 3 channel state signals.
*   `<NC_IDX_OPP_3_S_0>` through `<NC_IDX_OPP_3_S_2>`: Additional operating point state signals.
*   `<NC_IDX_CH_3_S_0>` through `<NC_IDX_CH_3_S_2>`: Additional channel state signals.

*   `<PV_AV>`: Pedal value or similar driver demand.
*   `<LV_ENG_IST_STST>`: Engine standstill or start-stop status.
*   `<MAF_STK_SP_TQS>`: Mass air flow set point for torque.
*   `<TCO_S>`: Coolant temperature sensor signal.
*   `<ACTION_INFR_SetPortDeac>`: An inferred action or command to set port deactivation, also serving as feedback.

**Initialization Inputs:**
*   `ini` (to `fc(i)` block): General initialization signal.
*   `RST`, `IGKON`: Reset and Ignition ON signals for `APP_CDN`.

## Outputs

The primary and sole external output of this diagram is:

*   `<LV_PORT_DEAC>`: The deactivation signal for the port flap system.

**Intermediate/Internal Outputs (from `OPM_10MS X.2` to final output block):**
*   `LV_PORT_CMB_CH_ACT` (appears twice)
*   `LV_PORT_CMB_OPP_1_NOT`
*   `LV_PORT_CMB_SCAV_REQ`
*   `LV_PORT_DEAC_BAS`
*   `LV_PORT_DEAC_RAW_DYN`
*   `LV_PORT_DEAC_RAW_BAS`
*   `LV_PORT_DEAC_RAW_SCAV`
*   `MAF_STK_SP_TQI_TMP`
*   `MAP_SP_GRD_PORT_DYN`
*   `N_GRD_MMW_PORT_SCAV`
*   `N_32_TMP`
*   `T_PORT_SCAV`
*   `T_PORT_SCAV_INI`
*   `T_PORT_SP_DYN_ACT`
*   `T_PORT_SP_DYN_MAX`
*   `T_PRED_PORT_SCAV`

## Logic Flow

The logical flow of the diagram can be broken down into three main stages: initialization and application condition processing, core port flap set point processing, and final deactivation signal generation.

1.  **Initialization and Application Condition Processing (`fc(i)` and `APP_CDN V.5.14`):**
    *   The process begins with initialization. The `fc(i)` block likely handles generic initialization procedures based on the `ini` signal.
    *   The `APP_CDN V.5.14` block represents the "Application Conditions" module. It is perpetually active (`Activation: always`) and recurrently processes inputs every 10 milliseconds (`Recurrence: 10MS`). It handles initial setup based on `RST` (reset) and `IGKON` (ignition on) signals.
    *   This block takes a multitude of raw sensor readings, system states, and driver commands (e.g., `<LV_STP>`, `<GEAR>`, `<N_GRD>`, various index signals). It likely preprocesses, filters, or validates these inputs.
    *   It also receives `<ACTION_INFR_SetPortDeac>` as an input, suggesting it either reacts to or generates this command.
    *   The outputs of `APP_CDN V.5.14` are bundled into a bus labeled `input`, containing several signals related to port deactivation, combustion, scavenging, and set point parameters.

2.  **Core Port Flap Set Point Processing (`OPM_10MS X.2`):**
    *   The `input` bus from `APP_CDN V.5.14` feeds into the `OPM_10MS X.2` block, which is the central computational unit. "OPM" likely stands for "Operating Point Management" or "Output Processing Module." Its `10MS` designation indicates it operates at the specified recurrence rate.
    *   This block performs the core logic for "Port flap position set point actuation signal processing." It calculates various intermediate signals such as `LV_PORT_CMB_CH_ACT` (port combination channel active), `LV_PORT_DEAC_BAS` (port deactivation basic), `T_PORT_SCAV` (port scavenging temperature), and others related to dynamic and raw values of deactivation, scavenging, and set points.
    *   Crucially, `OPM_10MS X.2` also receives a `feedback` signal, which is `ACTION_INFR_SetPortDeac`. This indicates a feedback loop where the module's current processing or state might be influenced by a previous command or status regarding port deactivation, enabling dynamic or state-dependent control.

3.  **Final Output Generation (`V.8.6` output block):**
    *   The multiple intermediate outputs from `OPM_10MS X.2` (including various `LV_PORT_DEAC` components, `LV_PORT_CMB_`, `MAF_STK_SP_`, `T_PORT_SCAV`, etc.) are routed to a final output aggregation block (labeled `V.8.6`).
    *   This block takes all these detailed signals and consolidates them into the single, final output: `<LV_PORT_DEAC>`. This step likely involves a selection, prioritization, or final logical decision to determine the definitive deactivation status of the port flap system.


--- Page 15 ---

## Function
This Simulink diagram illustrates a high-level component responsible for processing signals related to the actuation set point for a port flap position. Specifically, it shows a subsystem that generates a "Port Deactivation" signal. The overall context, as indicated by the title "AIRM. Port flap position set point actuation signal processing", suggests this is part of a larger air management or intake runner system in an automotive application.

## Inputs
Based on the visible diagram:
*   **No explicit input ports are shown entering the depicted subsystem `C_PORT_DEAC_SUB` from the outside of this specific diagram view.** It is a subsystem, so it inherently takes inputs, but they are either internal to this graphical representation (e.g., from blocks not shown within the same parent level) or are fed directly into the `C_PORT_DEAC_SUB` block from higher levels of the model hierarchy which are not visible here.

## Outputs
*   **LV_PORT_DEAC:** This is the primary output signal, routed via a Simulink `Goto` block. It represents the processed "Port Deactivation" value or command. The `Goto` block makes this signal available globally (or within a defined scope) to other parts of the Simulink model through a corresponding `From` block.

## Logic Flow
1.  **Subsystem Processing:** The core of the logic resides within the `C_PORT_DEAC_SUB` block (version V.6.4). This subsystem is responsible for taking relevant input signals (not explicitly shown in this view) and performing the necessary calculations or logic to determine the "Port Deactivation" signal. The name implies it calculates a value related to whether a port (likely an intake port or flap) should be deactivated.
2.  **Signal Routing:** Once `C_PORT_DEAC_SUB` has computed its output, this signal is fed directly into a `Goto` block labeled `LV_PORT_DEAC`.
3.  **Global Availability:** The `Goto` block, indexed with '1', serves to make the `LV_PORT_DEAC` signal available as a global signal within the Simulink model. Any `From` block with the corresponding tag (`LV_PORT_DEAC`) elsewhere in the model can then retrieve and use this computed deactivation signal for further control or actuation.

This image is a Simulink diagram representing a logical control system.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is "Operating state detection" for "Port flap position set point actuation signal processing," as stated in the title. It takes a single input representing the current system mode or state (likely an enumerated value or index) and evaluates it against predefined sets of conditions to generate three distinct boolean output flags. These flags indicate specific operational requirements or states related to the port flap system, such as "Port Combine Opposite 1 Not," "Port Combine Channel Active," and "Port Combine Scavenging Request."

## Inputs
The diagram features a single primary input signal, originating from the "Input" block on the left. This signal is fanned out to multiple comparison blocks. The effective inputs to the logic are:
1.  **System Mode/State Index (dynamic input from "Input" block):** This is the variable input whose value determines the system's current state or request.
2.  **Predefined Mode/State Constants (parameters for comparison):** These are the enumerated values or indices against which the dynamic input is compared. They are explicitly named within the "Equals" blocks:
    *   `<IDX_CMB_MOD_CUR>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_OPP_2>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_OPP_2_S_1>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_OPP_3_HOMS_S>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_2>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_2_S_1>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_3_HOMS_S>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_OPP_MPI_2>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_OPP_MPI_2_S>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_OPP_MPI_3>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_OPP_MPI_3_S_1>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_OPP_MPI_4_S_2>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_CH_2>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_CH_2_S_1>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_CH_3_S_2>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_CH_MPI_2_S>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_CH_SA_MPI_2>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_CH_SA_MPI_2_S_1>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_CH_SA_3_S_1>`
    *   `<IDX_CMB_MOD_REQ>`
    *   `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_1>`

## Outputs
There are three boolean (logical) outputs generated by the diagram:
1.  **`LV_PORT_CMB_OPP_1_NOT`**: A logical flag indicating a "Port Combine Opposite 1 Not" condition.
2.  **`LV_PORT_CMB_CH_ACT`**: A logical flag indicating a "Port Combine Channel Active" condition.
3.  **`LV_PORT_CMB_SCAV_REQ`**: A logical flag indicating a "Port Combine Scavenging Request."

## Logic Flow

The diagram processes the input signal through three independent logical branches, each leading to one of the outputs. The core logic in each branch follows a pattern of comparison followed by an OR operation.

**General Step-by-Step Logic for Each Branch:**

1.  **Input Signal Distribution:** A single dynamic input signal (from the "Input" block) is broadcast to a set of "Equals" (==) comparison blocks within each branch.
2.  **Individual Mode/State Comparison:** Each "Equals" block compares the value of the dynamic input signal against a specific, predefined mode/state constant (e.g., `<NC_IDX_OPP_2>`).
    *   If the dynamic input matches the specific constant, the output of the "Equals" block is TRUE.
    *   If there is no match, the output is FALSE.
3.  **OR Gate Aggregation:** The boolean outputs from all the "Equals" blocks within a given branch are fed into a multi-input "OR" gate.
4.  **Output Generation:** The "OR" gate's output becomes TRUE if *any* of its inputs are TRUE (meaning the dynamic input matched at least one of the specific mode/state constants in that branch's set). The output becomes FALSE only if *all* its inputs are FALSE (meaning the dynamic input matched none of the specific mode/state constants in that branch's set). This final boolean value is then assigned to the respective output signal.

**Specific Branch Details:**

*   **Branch 1 (for `LV_PORT_CMB_OPP_1_NOT`):**
    *   The "Input" signal is compared against 12 different mode/state constants, including `<IDX_CMB_MOD_CUR>`, `<NC_IDX_OPP_2>`, `<NC_IDX_OPP_2_S_1>`, `<NC_IDX_OPP_3_HOMS_S>`, `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_2>`, `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_2_S_1>`, `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_3_HOMS_S>`, `<NC_IDX_OPP_MPI_2>`, `<NC_IDX_OPP_MPI_2_S>`, `<NC_IDX_OPP_MPI_3>`, `<NC_IDX_OPP_MPI_3_S_1>`, and `<NC_IDX_OPP_MPI_4_S_2>`.
    *   The `LV_PORT_CMB_OPP_1_NOT` output is TRUE if the "Input" matches *any* of these 12 constants.

*   **Branch 2 (for `LV_PORT_CMB_CH_ACT`):**
    *   The "Input" signal is compared against 12 different mode/state constants, including `<IDX_CMB_MOD_CUR>`, `<NC_IDX_CH_2>`, `<NC_IDX_CH_2_S_1>`, `<NC_IDX_CH_3_S_2>`, `<NC_IDX_CH_MPI_2_S>`, `<NC_IDX_CH_SA_MPI_2>`, `<NC_IDX_CH_SA_MPI_2_S_1>`, and `<NC_IDX_CH_SA_3_S_1>`, along with additional `<IDX_CMB_MOD_CUR>` comparisons.
    *   The `LV_PORT_CMB_CH_ACT` output is TRUE if the "Input" matches *any* of these 12 constants.

*   **Branch 3 (for `LV_PORT_CMB_SCAV_REQ`):**
    *   The "Input" signal is compared against 6 different mode/state constants, including `<IDX_CMB_MOD_REQ>`, `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_1>`, `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_2>`, `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_2_S_1>`, and `<NC_IDX_SCAV_OPP_3_HOMS_S>`, along with additional `<IDX_CMB_MOD_REQ>` comparisons.
    *   The `LV_PORT_CMB_SCAV_REQ` output is TRUE if the "Input" matches *any* of these 6 constants.

The `V.6.2` and `V.6.3` labels likely denote specific library blocks or versioning information within the Simulink environment. This structure effectively creates a multi-state switch, where the system's operating state or desired action is determined by checking if the current system mode falls into predefined categories.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram, titled "AIRM. Port flap position set point actuation signal processing", is to dynamically determine the raw base set point for the engine's port flap deactivation. This system processes various engine operating parameters to calculate a signal (`LV_PORT_DEAC_RAW_BAS`) that dictates the desired state or position of the port flaps, aiming to prevent drivability issues and manage engine load changes smoothly.

## Inputs
The diagram receives the following key inputs:
*   **N_32**: Engine speed, likely in RPM or a scaled equivalent.
*   **MAF_STK_SP_TQI**: Mass Airflow Stack Set Point Torque Equivalent, representing the engine's demanded load or torque.
*   **GEAR**: The current gear engaged in the vehicle's transmission.
*   **C_TIA_PORT_HYS**: A constant value related to the hysteresis for the port flap's charge motion activation (TIA - Tumbling Intake Air).
*   **TCO_STS**: Thermal Condition Status, indicating the engine's temperature or warm-up state.
*   **LV_CH**: Load Value Channel, which might represent a specific operating mode or load path selection.

## Outputs
The diagram produces the following primary output:
*   **LV_PORT_DEAC_RAW_BAS**: Load Value Port Deactivation Raw Base, which is the calculated raw set point for controlling the port flap deactivation.

Additionally, two temporary, processed input signals are outputted, likely for monitoring or use in other subsystems:
*   **N_32_TMP**: A temporarily processed version of the engine speed.
*   **MAF_STK_SP_TQI_TMP**: A temporarily processed version of the mass airflow/load signal.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow can be broken down into several stages:

1.  **Input Conditioning and Hysteresis (Top Section):**
    *   The raw engine speed (`N_32`) and mass airflow/load (`MAF_STK_SP_TQI`) inputs are first processed through dedicated blocks (`IP_N_SP_PORT_HYS` and `IP_MAF_SP_TQI_PORT_HYS`). These blocks likely incorporate hysteresis and filtering (indicated by their names containing `HYS` and feedback paths from `LV_PORT_DEAC_RAW_BAS_fld` and V.6.4 blocks) to generate smoothed and debounced temporary values: `N_32_TMP` and `MAF_STK_SP_TQI_TMP`. This ensures stable operation and prevents oscillations.
    *   The outputs `N_32_TMP` and `MAF_STK_SP_TQI_TMP` serve as the primary independent variables (X and Y axes) for most subsequent 2D lookup tables.

2.  **Lookup Table-Based Set Point Determination:**
    *   A multitude of 2D lookup tables (e.g., `ID_PORT_SP_GEAR_TIA_OPP_NOT`, `ID_PORT_SP_GEAR_OPP_1_NOT`, `ID_PORT_SP_CMB_CH`, `ID_PORT_SP_CH`, `ID_PORT_SP_GEAR_TIA`, `ID_PORT_SP_GEAR`, `ID_IDX_GEAR_PORT`, `ID_PORT_SP_CMB_CH_ACT`), denoted by the `V.7.3` blocks, are distributed throughout the diagram.
    *   These lookup tables take `N_32_TMP` and `MAF_STK_SP_TQI_TMP` as inputs to determine various intermediate `ID_val` signals. These `ID_val`s represent specific set points, thresholds, or flags corresponding to the engine's current operating condition (speed and load).

3.  **Gear and Hysteresis Logic:**
    *   The `GEAR` input is used with the `ID_TIA_PORT_SP` lookup table to determine an `ID_val`.
    *   This `ID_val` is summed with the `C_TIA_PORT_HYS` constant (via block `V.7.2`) and then processed by block `V.6.4`. This `V.6.4` block's output acts as an input (`x_in`) to several hysteretic switches (`V.6.7` blocks).
    *   The `V.6.7` blocks (characterized by `LSP`, `RSP`, `x_in`, `x_out`) introduce hysteretic switching behavior, where the output's transition between states depends on crossing distinct upper (RSP) and lower (LSP) set points. The `LSP` and `RSP` values for these switches are also derived from other 2D lookup tables, making their behavior context-dependent.
    *   The outputs of these `V.6.7` blocks are then compared against a threshold of 0.5 (via `V.6.6` blocks) to generate binary flags, indicating specific conditions or desired port flap states (e.g., `LV_PORT_CMB_OPP_1_NOT`, `LV_PORT_CMB_CH_ACT`).

4.  **Thermal and Load Channel Influence:**
    *   The `TCO_STS` (Thermal Condition Status) input feeds into lookup tables `ID_TCO_ST_PORT_ENA` and `ID_FAC_PORT_TCO`. The output of `ID_TCO_ST_PORT_ENA` is thresholded (V.6.6), and then multiplied with the output of `ID_FAC_PORT_TCO`. This path likely enables or scales a factor based on engine temperature, influencing the port flap operation during warm-up or specific thermal conditions.
    *   The `LV_CH` (Load Value Channel) input similarly affects other lookup tables (`ID_PORT_SP_CH`, `ID_PORT_SP_CMB_CH_ACT`), and their outputs also contribute to the hysteretic switch logic (`V.6.7`) and thresholding (`V.6.6`) to produce specific load-channel-related flags.

5.  **Final Output Determination:**
    *   The numerous intermediate binary flags and scaled values from the various lookup tables, hysteretic switches, and threshold comparators are logically combined. While the exact logical combination (AND, OR, selection) is not explicitly drawn with distinct logic gates, the signal flow implies a complex decision-making process.
    *   The final output, `LV_PORT_DEAC_RAW_BAS`, is generated after a comparison `Check == 0` (via `V.6.10` block) on a composite signal that includes the scaled thermal factor. This suggests that `LV_PORT_DEAC_RAW_BAS` is a binary or continuously scaled value indicating the raw base set point for deactivating the port flaps, with a final condition check before output.

In essence, the diagram integrates engine speed, load, gear, thermal state, and specific channel selections through a network of lookup tables, hysteretic switches, and threshold logic to calculate a robust and dynamic port flap deactivation set point. The extensive use of hysteresis and filtering aims to ensure smooth and stable control, critical for optimal engine performance and drivability.

14. **`<V_PORT_MEM: O_V>`**: Output value for memory related to port.

## Logic Flow

The function operates periodically every 40ms, initializing on system reset and ignition on, and running continuously thereafter. The logical flow can be broken down into these steps:

1.  **Input Acquisition:** All defined inputs (status flags, configuration values, error flags, action requests) are sampled at the beginning of each 40ms cycle. These provide the current state of the port flap actuator and associated systems.

2.  **Initial State Processing (`INI X.1`):**
    *   An `INI X.1` block receives initial inputs (`fc_INs`, `fc_ini`) and possibly other context-related data.
    *   It calculates and outputs a set of "Left Flap State Diagnosis" (`LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_...`) flags, representing initial or persistent diagnostic states for mechanical down, down-over, up, and up-over conditions. These outputs are directly available as system outputs.
    *   It also determines an initial `LV_V_PORT_MEM` value, which is output directly.
    *   Crucially, this block also seems to provide a `CLR_RST` signal, suggesting it plays a role in initializing or resetting other internal components.

3.  **Clear/Reset Logic (`CLR_RST X.3`):**
    *   This block takes a `feedback` signal (likely from later stages for state management) and the `CLR_RST` signal (presumably from `INI X.1` or similar initialisation logic).
    *   It processes these to generate an internal signal `f(i)`, which is then fed into the main operational logic block (`OPM`). This suggests `CLR_RST X.3` handles the clearing or resetting of specific internal states or timers based on system conditions or explicit reset commands.

4.  **Core Operational and Diagnostic Processing (`f(i)` and `OPM`):**
    *   A generic function block `f(i)` processes a subset of the raw system inputs (`input`) to generate an internal derived signal `f(i)`. This could represent aggregated status or calculated values.
    *   The `OPM` block is central to the diagnosis. It receives the `f(i)` signal from `CLR_RST X.3`, the output `f(i)` from the other generic function block, a set of raw system inputs (`input`), and action commands (`ACTION_AIRM_ResultDiag`, `ACTION_AIRM_GetPermission`).
    *   It also incorporates internal `feedback` (from `OPM X.2`) to maintain state across cycles, which is critical for diagnostics (e.g., debouncing, fault counting, state transitions).
    *   Based on these inputs, `OPM` calculates various "Timer Port Diagnosis Mechanical" (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_...`) values, which likely represent accumulated time in certain fault states or state durations.
    *   It also updates a general `V_PORT_MEM` value.
    *   The `OPM` block's output itself (`OPM`) is fed back into `OPM X.2`.

5.  **Feedback and Memory Update (`OPM X.2`):**
    *   The `OPM X.2` block receives the main `OPM` output.
    *   It generates a `feedback` signal that is routed back to the `CLR_RST X.3` block and potentially the `OPM` block (implied by the dashed line, often representing state or memory feedback). This loop enables the system to maintain historical context and internal states necessary for complex diagnostic algorithms.

6.  **Output Generation:**
    *   The `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_...` and `LV_V_PORT_MEM` outputs are directly derived from the `INI X.1` block.
    *   The `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_...` and `V_PORT_MEM` outputs are generated by the `OPM` block.
    *   Several `ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeC...` outputs are generated. Although their trigger logic is not explicitly shown as blocks, these are typically commands issued by the diagnostic system when certain conditions are met (e.g., a fault is cleared, or a manual reset is requested) to reset specific diagnostic flags related to port flap movement and over-travel.

In essence, the system continuously assesses the port flap's condition using real-time data, manages internal states and timers, and provides clear diagnostic outputs and reset capabilities, ensuring reliable operation and fault detection for the port flap actuator.

This image is a Simulink diagram, specifically a "For Iterator Subsystem".

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink subsystem is to iterate through a specified number of "Port flap actuators" (indicated by `NC_PORT_NR`) and extract, process, or make available specific diagnostic and status signals for each individual port. It conditionally selects the diagnostic data bus for the current port in the iteration (specifically handling `V_PORT_1` and `V_PORT_2` explicitly) and then extracts numerous parameters from that bus. This is a common pattern for applying the same logic to multiple instances of a component within a system, particularly for diagnosis as suggested by "AIRM. Port flap actuator diagnosis".

## Inputs
*   **`NC_PORT_NR`**: An integer scalar representing the total number of port flaps to iterate through. This determines the loop count for the "For Iterator Subsystem". (Appears multiple times as a `From` block source and an input to the iterator).
*   **`V_PORT_1`**: A bus signal (or structure) containing diagnostic and status data for the first port flap. It's sourced from a `From` block named `From3`.
*   **`V_PORT_2`**: A bus signal (or structure) containing diagnostic and status data for the second port flap. It's sourced from a `From` block named `From6`.
*   **`V_PORT_J`**: A global `Goto` tag, likely representing the currently iterated port's full data bus, which can be accessed by `From1` and `From5` blocks elsewhere in the model. This is both an input and an output depending on the connection point.

## Outputs
The subsystem outputs a comprehensive list of individual diagnostic and status signals, derived from the selected `V_PORT_i` bus. These signals are specific to the currently iterated port. Examples include:
*   **`LV_PORT_AD_ACT`**: Port actuator actual value.
*   **`LV_PORT_AD_VLD`**: Port actuator valid status.
*   **`LC_PORT_AD_DIAG_ENA`**: Port actuator diagnostic enable status.
*   **`STATE_PORT_AD`**: Port actuator state.
*   **`NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_AD`**: Port actuator error index.
*   **`LV_ST`**: Level status.
*   **`V_PORT_1_RAW`, `V_PORT_2_RAW`**: Raw data for Port 1 and Port 2.
*   **`NC_FID_ERR_PORT_FB_EL_H`, `NC_FID_ERR_PORT_FB_EL_L`**: Feedback error flags (high/low).
*   **`LV_PORT_DEAC`**: Port deactivated status.
*   **`V_PORT_AD_OPEN`**: Port actuator open command.
*   **`NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_i`, `NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_i`**: Mechanical error flags (up/down) for port i.
*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER_fb`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_fb`**: Diagnostic timer feedback for mechanical up/down over.
*   **`TIA_IM`, `TCO`**: Timer values.
*   **`V_PORT_MEM_fb`**: Port memory feedback.
*   **`C_V_PORT_AD_OPEN_HYS`, `C_V_PORT_AD_CLOSE_HYS`**: Port actuator open/close hysteresis.
*   **`LV_V_PORT_MEM`**: Port memory level.
*   **`LV_IS`, `LV_PL`, `LV_ST_END`**: Various level and status indicators.
*   **`V_PORT_AD_CLOSE`**: Port actuator close command.
*   **`NC_PORT_NR_tmp`**: A temporary or processed version of `NC_PORT_NR`.
*   **`OPM`**: An output from a "Data Type Conversion" block, potentially representing a processed count or size related to `NC_PORT_NR`.
*   **`V_PORT_I`**: A `From` block output (`From5`), likely representing the selected port's bus data for external consumption.
*   **`V_PORT_J`**: A `Goto` tag output, also representing the selected port's bus data.

## Logic Flow

1.  **Iteration Initialization**: The "For Iterator Subsystem" receives `NC_PORT_NR` as its loop limit. It generates an iteration index `i` (V.6.2, V.6.4) which typically ranges from 1 to `NC_PORT_NR`.
2.  **Conditional Port Data Selection**:
    *   The index `i` is compared with `1` and `2` using equality blocks.
    *   An "If" block (V.6.0) evaluates these conditions:
        *   If `i == 1`, the diagnostic bus `V_PORT_1` (from `From3`) is selected.
        *   If `i == 2`, the diagnostic bus `V_PORT_2` (from `From6`) is selected.
        *   An `else` path is present but not explicitly connected to a data source, implying that for `i > 2`, either a default/zero-value bus is passed, or other `V_PORT_i` inputs (not fully depicted) are implicitly handled.
3.  **Merge Selected Port Data**: The selected diagnostic bus from the "If" block's output (either `V_PORT_1` or `V_PORT_2` for `i=1` or `i=2`, respectively) is routed through a "Merge" block (V.6.0). The output of this merge block is labelled `V_PORT_i`, representing the complete diagnostic data bus for the currently processed port.
4.  **Global Port Data Propagation**: The `V_PORT_i` bus is fed into a `Goto` block named `V_PORT_J`. This allows other parts of the larger Simulink model to access the current port's diagnostic data using `From` blocks (`From1`, `From5`).
5.  **Signal Extraction**: The `V_PORT_i` bus then connects to a large "Bus Selector" block. This block extracts individual diagnostic parameters (e.g., `LV_PORT_AD_ACT`, `STATE_PORT_AD`, various error flags, timer values) from the composite bus structure.
6.  **Output Signals**: These extracted individual parameters become the direct outputs of the "Port flap actuator diagnosis" subsystem, making them available for further processing or monitoring.
7.  **Auxiliary Output `OPM`**: Separately, the `NC_PORT_NR` signal is fed to a "Data Type Conversion" block (from `int32` to `u`) and then to a bus selector (`C`) to produce the `OPM` output, possibly indicating the number of operational ports or a processed port count.

This image displays a block diagram that closely resembles a Simulink model, used for diagnosing a specific automotive system.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to perform **diagnosis of port-flap adaptation**. It evaluates various input conditions related to the port flap's state, errors, and adaptation levels to determine a diagnostic result. This result is then passed to an `ActionImport` block, which likely processes or logs these diagnostic findings.

## Inputs
The diagram receives the following key inputs:
*   **LC_PORT_AD_DIAG_ENA**: (Local Port Adaptation Diagnostic Enable) A boolean or flag indicating if the diagnostic function for port adaptation is enabled.
*   **STATE_PORT_AD**: (State of Port Adaptation) A discrete value representing the current operational state of the port adaptation.
*   **PORT_AD_ERR**: (Port Adaptation Error) An error code or status indicating an error in the port adaptation process.
*   **LV_PORT_AD_VLD_i**: (Level Port Adaptation Valid Input) A boolean or flag indicating the validity of the port adaptation level.
*   **LV_PORT_AD_ACT**: (Level Port Adaptation Actual) A discrete value representing the actual or current adaptation level of the port flap.

## Outputs
The diagram computes several diagnostic values which are fed as inputs to the `ActionImport` block. These can be considered the outputs of this specific diagnostic logic block:
*   **ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag**: The main diagnostic result or error code for the port flap adaptation.
*   **PRM_IDX_ERR**: (Parameter Index Error) An error index (constant value 3 in this diagram, representing "CND + SYM -> FAILURE").
*   **PRM_STATE_FIL**: (Parameter State Filtered) A filtered parameter state (constant value 0 in this diagram).
*   **PRM_STATE_DGO**: (Parameter State Diagnostic Output) A diagnostic parameter state (constant value 0 in this diagram).
*   **if_state_dgo_port_ad_i**: An intermediate diagnostic state related to the validity and actual level of port adaptation.

## Logic Flow

The logic flow can be understood as two parallel diagnostic paths that converge to provide inputs to the `ActionImport` block. The multiplexer blocks (indicated by `Check ~= 0 V.6.6`) function as switches: if the control input (middle input) is non-zero (true), the top input is selected; otherwise (control input is zero/false), the bottom input is selected.

**1. Top Path: Determining ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag**

*   **Conditions for Failure (Input to Mux 2):**
    *   `LC_PORT_AD_DIAG_ENA` is compared to `1` (check if diagnostic is enabled).
    *   `STATE_PORT_AD` is compared to `1` (check if port adaptation is in a specific state, likely an active or required state).
    *   The results of these two comparisons are combined with an `AND` operation. If both are true, this indicates a condition where failure (value `3`) might be assigned.
*   **Error Code Evaluation (Input to Mux 2):**
    *   `PORT_AD_ERR` is used as the control input for the first multiplexer in this path.
    *   If `PORT_AD_ERR` is non-zero (meaning an error exists, and `PORT_AD_ERR` holds the error code), the multiplexer outputs `PORT_AD_ERR` itself.
    *   If `PORT_AD_ERR` is zero (no error), the multiplexer outputs `1` (which might signify a "no error detected" or default state when the error condition is not met).
*   **Final ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag Determination:**
    *   The output of the `AND` operation (from "Conditions for Failure") controls the second multiplexer.
    *   If the `AND` condition is true (diagnostic enabled AND state is `1`), the multiplexer outputs `3` (labeled "CND + SYM -> FAILURE"), which means a failure condition is detected. This `3` then directly becomes `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag`.
    *   Otherwise (if the `AND` condition is false), the multiplexer outputs the result from the "Error Code Evaluation" step. This means `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag` will be either the `PORT_AD_ERR` code (if non-zero) or `1` (if `PORT_AD_ERR` was zero).

**2. Bottom Path: Determining if_state_dgo_port_ad_i**

*   **Conditions:**
    *   `LV_PORT_AD_VLD_i` is compared to `0` (check if port adaptation level is not valid).
    *   `LV_PORT_AD_ACT` is compared to `1` (check if actual port adaptation level is `1`, likely a specific adapted state).
*   **Intermediate Output (Input to Mux 2):**
    *   The result of `LV_PORT_AD_ACT == 1` controls the first multiplexer in this path.
    *   If `LV_PORT_AD_ACT == 1` is true, the multiplexer outputs `1`.
    *   If `LV_PORT_AD_ACT == 1` is false, the multiplexer outputs `0`.
*   **Final if_state_dgo_port_ad_i Determination:**
    *   The result of `LV_PORT_AD_VLD_i == 0` controls the second multiplexer.
    *   If `LV_PORT_AD_VLD_i == 0` is true (level is not valid), the multiplexer outputs `0` (labeled "NO_CDN"). This `0` then directly becomes `if_state_dgo_port_ad_i`.
    *   Otherwise (if `LV_PORT_AD_VLD_i == 0` is false, meaning the level is valid), the multiplexer outputs the result from the "Intermediate Output" step. This means `if_state_dgo_port_ad_i` will be `1` (if `LV_PORT_AD_ACT == 1`) or `0` (if `LV_PORT_AD_ACT != 1`).
    *   In summary, `if_state_dgo_port_ad_i` is `1` only if `LV_PORT_AD_VLD_i` is **not** `0` AND `LV_PORT_AD_ACT` is `1`. Otherwise, it's `0`.

**3. ActionImport Block:**

*   This block takes `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag` and `if_state_dgo_port_ad_i` as its primary diagnostic inputs.
*   It also receives constant values for `PRM_IDX_ERR` (always `3`), `PRM_STATE_FIL` (always `0`), and `PRM_STATE_DGO` (always `0`).
*   The `ActionImport` block is likely a function call or a subsystem that processes these diagnostic results, potentially logging them, triggering fault codes, or influencing other system behaviors based on the determined states.

This image contains two distinct Simulink diagrams, both related to "AIRM: Port flap actuator diagnosis". I will analyze them as two separate diagnostic functionalities within a larger automotive system.

## Function

The primary function of the depicted Simulink diagrams is to perform comprehensive diagnostic checks on an automotive "Port Flap Actuator" system. This involves two main areas:
1.  **Electrical Fault Detection (Figure 2.5.10):** Identifying "short to ground" or "open loop" conditions within the actuator's electrical circuitry by monitoring raw voltage readings and other feedback signals.
2.  **Mechanical Stuck Detection (Figure 2.5.11):** Determining if the port flap is physically stuck in either the "up" or "down" position, based on various sensor readings, timing, and system state inputs.
Together, these diagrams contribute to the robust fault diagnosis of the port flap actuator, ensuring its proper operation and identifying potential failures.

## Inputs

The key inputs to the overall system (combining both diagrams) are:

*   **V_PORT_RAW_tmp:** Temporary raw voltage reading from the port (for electrical fault detection).
*   **C_V_PORT_MIN_DIAG:** A constant or parameter defining the minimum diagnostic voltage threshold (for electrical fault detection).
*   **ACTION_FARM_GetPermission (and _T3 variant):** A signal indicating permission from an "Action Farm" (likely a central control logic) to execute diagnostic actions or functions.
*   **NC_FID_ERR_PORT_FB_EL_L_I:** Feedback indicating a "No Current" Fault ID Error for the port's electrical path.
*   **PRM_FID:** A parameter specifying a Fault ID.
*   **PRM_LV_PRMS:** Parameters related to level permissions.
*   **LF_STATE_DGO_FB_EL_L_I:** Feedback for the "Lift/Lower" state of the Diagnostic GO signal for the electrical path.
*   **PRM_STATE_FIL:** A parameter indicating a filtering state for diagnostic results.
*   **fc_call:** A function call trigger to initiate the "Port flap stuck check" subsystem.
*   **input (Bus):** A bus containing multiple signals for the "port flap stuck check (UP)" including:
    *   V_PORT_I, T_AST, LV_PORT_DEAC, V_PORT_AD_OPEN, NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_I, NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_I, T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_I, T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb, C_V_PORT_AD_OPEN_HYS, ACTION_FARM_GetPermission_T3, ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag_T3.
*   **actions (Bus):** A bus containing multiple signals for the "port flap stuck check (DOWN)" including:
    *   V_PORT_I, T_AST, LV_PORT_DEAC, V_PORT_AD_CLOSE, NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_I, NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_I, T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb, T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_I, C_V_PORT_AD_CLOSE_HYS, ACTION_FARM_GetPermission_T3, ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag_T3.

## Outputs

The key outputs from the overall system (combining both diagrams) are:

*   **ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag (and _T3 variant):** The resulting diagnostic status from the error management system.
*   **NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_FB_EL_L:** An indexed error signal for the port's electrical path, indicating a "No Current" fault.
*   **PRM_IDX_ERR:** An indexed parameter error.
*   **PRM_STATE_FID:** The state of the Fault ID parameter.
*   **PRM_STATE_DGO:** The state of the Diagnostic GO parameter.
*   **PRM_CMM_ERR:** A parameter related to command errors.
*   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP:** A diagnostic time or status indicating if the port flap is mechanically stuck in the "up" position.
*   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN:** A diagnostic time or status indicating if the port flap is mechanically stuck in the "down" position.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow is described separately for each diagram:

### 1. Logic Flow: "Short cut to ground or open loop" (Figure 2.5.10)

1.  **Voltage Monitoring and Threshold Check:** The raw port voltage (`V_PORT_RAW_tmp`) is continuously monitored and compared against a minimum diagnostic voltage threshold (`C_V_PORT_MIN_DIAG`) using a `<` (less than) comparator. A voltage below this threshold suggests a potential electrical fault like a short to ground or an open circuit.
2.  **Initial Validation (Check Blocks):** The result of the voltage comparison and a constant value `3` are fed into `Check` blocks (labeled V.6.4). These blocks likely perform initial validation or specific conditional checks on their inputs. An output from the top `Check` block feeds into another `Check -> 0` block (V.6.6), which might verify if a signal is zero or evaluate a specific condition.
3.  **Intermediate Diagnostic Assessment (ActionImport Subsystem 1):** An `ActionImport` block (representing a subsystem or function call) receives:
    *   The permission to proceed (`ACTION_FARM_GetPermission`).
    *   Feedback on electrical path errors (`NC_FID_ERR_PORT_FB_EL_L_I`).
    *   The output from the upper `Check -> 0` block.
    This subsystem processes these inputs to contribute to the overall diagnostic result (`ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag`) and determine a diagnostic state (`PRM_STATE_DGO`).
4.  **Signal Routing and Selection:** Signals like `NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_FB_EL_L` and `LF_STATE_DGO_FB_EL_L` are generated or routed. A switch-like mechanism (controlled by a `0` (V.6.4) and `Check -> 0` (V.6.6) block) appears to select or combine these signals based on internal conditions.
5.  **Parameter-Based Diagnostic Input (ActionImport Subsystem 2):** Separately, another `ActionImport` block takes several parameters and feedback signals: `PRM_FID` (Fault ID), `PRM_LV_PRMS` (Level Permissions), `LF_STATE_DGO_FB_EL_L_I` (Diagnostic GO state feedback), and `ACTION_FARM_GetPermission`. This block is responsible for processing these parameters to contribute to the overall diagnostic context.
6.  **Final Diagnostic Consolidation (ActionImport Subsystem 3):** All relevant diagnostic information, including `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag` (from step 3) and `PRM_STATE_FIL` (filtering state), are fed into a final `ActionImport` block (the large yellow block on the far right). This subsystem aggregates all fault indications, states, and permissions to produce the comprehensive set of electrical diagnostic outputs: `PRM_IDX_ERR`, `PRM_STATE_FID`, `PRM_STATE_DGO`, and `PRM_CMM_ERR`.

### 2. Logic Flow: "Port flap stuck check" (Figure 2.5.11)

1.  **Function Call Trigger:** The diagnostic routine is activated by a `fc_call` signal, which serves as an event trigger for the subsystem.
2.  **Input Signal Demultiplexing:** Two "Bus Selector" blocks, labeled `input` and `actions`, receive comprehensive bus signals and extract individual sensor readings, feedback signals, diagnostic timings, and permissions relevant to checking the port flap's mechanical state.
3.  **Port Flap Stuck "Up" Check (`PORT_STUCK_CHK_MEC_UP`):**
    *   A dedicated subsystem, `PORT_STUCK_CHK_MEC_UP` (identified as `X.2.1.1.3.1`), receives all inputs pertinent to the "up" position. This includes voltage signals (`V_PORT_I`, `V_PORT_AD_OPEN`), timing (`T_AST`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`), deactivation status (`LV_PORT_DEAC`), and error feedback (`NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_I`, `NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_I`).
    *   Within this subsystem, complex logic (not detailed in this view) processes these inputs to determine if the flap is stuck in the "up" position.
    *   The primary output is `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`, which likely represents a diagnostic timer, status, or a fault flag for the "up" stuck condition.
4.  **Port Flap Stuck "Down" Check (`PORT_STUCK_CHK_MEC_DOWN`):**
    *   Another dedicated subsystem, `PORT_STUCK_CHK_MEC_DOWN` (identified as `X.2.1.1.3.2`), functions similarly but focuses on the "down" position. It receives inputs such as `V_PORT_I`, `T_AST`, `LV_PORT_DEAC`, `V_PORT_AD_CLOSE`, `NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_I`, `NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_I`, and `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb`.
    *   This subsystem evaluates whether the flap is stuck in the "down" position based on its specific set of inputs.
    *   Its main output is `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`, indicating the diagnostic status for the "down" stuck condition.
5.  **Output Merging:**
    *   `Merge1` takes the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` signal from the "Port Up" subsystem and routes it as an output of the overall "Port flap stuck check" system.
    *   `Merge2` takes the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` signal from the "Port Down" subsystem and routes it as another output.
    (Note: Merge blocks typically combine signals from different conditional execution paths; in this view, with single visible inputs, they primarily serve as a pass-through to consolidate outputs from parallel logic.)


--- Page 43 ---

This image is a Simulink-style diagram, typical for modeling automotive control and diagnostic logic.

## Function

The primary function of this diagram is to diagnose a mechanical failure condition in a port flap actuator: specifically, when the actuator fails to reach its designated "upper stop." It evaluates various inputs including permissions, operational times, and position signals to determine and report the diagnostic status related to this specific failure.

## Inputs

1.  **`ACTION_FARM_GetPermission`**: A boolean or enumerated input indicating general permission for diagnosis from the Feature/Function Allocation and Resource Management (FARM) system.
2.  **`NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_I`**: A numeric or enumerated input, likely a fault ID or index for the "Port Mechanical Up" error.
3.  **`T_AST`**: The current actuator operating time or an elapsed time relevant for diagnosis.
4.  **`C_T_AST_MIN_PORT_DIAG`**: A constant representing the minimum time required for port diagnosis.
5.  **`LV_PORT_DEAC`**: A boolean or numeric input indicating if the port is deactivated.
6.  **`V_PORT_AD_OPEN`**: An analog or digital input representing the port's "open" position or state.
7.  **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb`**: A feedback signal for the mechanical down movement diagnostic time.
8.  **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`**: A feedback signal for the mechanical up movement diagnostic time.
9.  **`V_PORT_i`**: An analog input representing the current value or position of the port.
10. **`C_V_PORT_AD_OPEN_HYS`**: A constant representing a hysteresis value for the port's "open" position.
11. **`ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag`**: An enabling signal or function command for the Error Result Management (ERRM) system.
12. **`NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_I`**: A numeric input, likely an error index specifically for the "Port Mechanical Up" diagnostic result.

## Outputs

1.  **`LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP`**: The main diagnostic state flag for "Port Mechanical Up," indicating whether the diagnosis is permitted/valid, and subsequently, the status of the "upper stop not reached" fault.
2.  **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`**: The diagnostic time related to the mechanical down movement.
3.  **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`**: The diagnostic time related to the mechanical up movement.

## Logic Flow

The diagram's logic can be broken down into several main sections:

1.  **Diagnosis Permission and Validity Check (Top Section):**
    *   `ACTION_FARM_GetPermission` and `NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_I` are processed by an `ActionImport` block (`PRM_LV_PRMS`) to determine specific permission levels.
    *   An **AND** gate (V.6.6) combines the output of `PRM_LV_PRMS` with `ACTION_FARM_GetPermission`. This ensures that general permission is active, and any specific permission parameters are met.
    *   The result of the AND gate controls a **Switch** block (V.6.4). If the AND condition is true (diagnosis is permitted/valid), the switch outputs `5` (VALID); otherwise, it outputs `0` (NO_VALID).
    *   This validity signal then feeds into another **Switch** block (V.6.6), which, based on the validity, outputs either `5` or `0` as the `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP` signal. This signal directly serves as an output of the system and also as `PRM_STATE_DGO` for the error reporting block, essentially establishing a preliminary diagnostic state based purely on permissions.

2.  **Minimum Diagnosis Time Evaluation (Middle Left):**
    *   The current actuator time `T_AST` is compared against a constant minimum required time `C_T_AST_MIN_PORT_DIAG` using a **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)** block (V.6.2).
    *   The boolean result of this comparison (`T_AST >= C_T_AST_MIN_PORT_DIAG`) is assigned to an intermediate signal `lf_state_dgo_port_mec_up_tmp`. This signal acts as an enabling condition for subsequent detailed diagnostic checks.

3.  **Core Mechanical Up Check (Middle Bottom):**
    *   A subsystem or function block named `CHK_MEC_UP` (located at `X.2.1.1.3.1.1`) performs the detailed logic for detecting if the "upper stop not reached" condition is present.
    *   Its inputs include `V_PORT_i` (current port position), `C_V_PORT_AD_OPEN_HYS` (hysteresis for open position), and the `lf_state_dgo_port_mec_up_tmp` (minimum diagnosis time met).
    *   This block calculates and outputs the actual diagnostic result for the mechanical up state, named `lf_state_dgo_port_mec_up`.

4.  **Diagnostic Result Reporting and Management (Bottom Section):**
    *   The `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag` block (a function call or subsystem for Error Result Management) processes the final diagnostic outcome.
    *   It takes multiple inputs: `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag` (command), `PRM_IDX_ERR` (error index), `PRM_STATE_FIL` (filtered error state), `PRM_STATE_DGO` (the `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP` signal from the permission check), and `lf_state_dgo_port_mec_up` (the detailed diagnostic result from `CHK_MEC_UP`).
    *   This block is responsible for consolidating these inputs and generating the official diagnostic fault status, likely by setting or clearing a diagnostic trouble code (DTC). The `≅` symbol implies further processing or comparison of the filtered state.

5.  **Diagnostic Time Outputs (Middle Right):**
    *   The feedback signals `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb` and `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb` are directly passed through and output as `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` and `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`, respectively. These are likely reported values of diagnostic timers or thresholds for monitoring.


--- Page 44 ---

## Function

This Simulink diagram implements a diagnostic check for a "Port flap actuator" to determine if it is in a mechanical "up" position. It consists of two main parts:
1.  **Condition Activation (`CHK_MEC_UP` - Figure 2.5.13):** This subsystem evaluates a set of conditions to determine if a specific diagnostic condition (`CDN_ACT`) related to the mechanical up state is currently active.
2.  **Diagnostic Data Processing (`Condition active and not yet de-bounced` - Figure 2.5.14):** This is a function-call subsystem that, when triggered by `CDN_ACT`, processes raw, un-debounced feedback signals to update and calculate the current diagnostic statuses for both mechanical up and down positions, as well as an overall temporary diagnostic state.

In essence, the system monitors the port flap actuator's mechanical up state, triggers a detailed diagnostic calculation when specific state conditions are met and the system is active, and then updates the diagnostic variables.

## Inputs

The following are the key input signals to this diagnostic system:

*   **`if_state_dgo_port_mec_up_tmp`**: A temporary internal state variable representing the current mechanical up diagnostic state.
*   **`[LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP]`**: A global internal state variable, read via a `From` block, representing the overall mechanical up diagnostic state.
*   **`LV_PORT_DEAC`**: A boolean or enumerated signal indicating the deactivation status of the port (e.g., 0 for active, 1 for deactivated).
*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb`**: A feedback or previous value representing the diagnostic status for the mechanical down position.
*   **`V_PORT_AD_OPEN`**: An Analog-to-Digital (AD) converter reading, likely representing a sensor value related to the port's open state.
*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`**: A feedback or previous value representing the diagnostic status for the mechanical up position.
*   **`V_PORT_I`**: A current measurement or feedback signal, likely related to the actuator's current consumption or position.
*   **`C_V_PORT_AD_OPEN_HYS`**: A constant value representing a hysteresis threshold for the `V_PORT_AD_OPEN` signal.

## Outputs

The system produces the following key output signals:

*   **`CDN_ACT`**: A boolean signal indicating if the overall diagnostic condition for mechanical up is currently active. This is an internal signal (using `Goto`) likely used to trigger other parts of the diagnostic system.
*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`**: The updated diagnostic status for the mechanical down position.
*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`**: The updated diagnostic status for the mechanical up position.
*   **`lf_state_dgo_port_mec_up`**: The updated temporary diagnostic state variable for the mechanical up position.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow can be broken down into two main stages corresponding to the two figures:

### Stage 1: Condition Activation Check (Figure 2.5.13 - `CHK_MEC_UP`)

1.  **State `5` Check (Mechanical Up):**
    *   The `if_state_dgo_port_mec_up_tmp` signal (temporary diagnostic state) is compared to the constant value `5` using an equality comparator (`==`).
    *   Simultaneously, the global `[LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP]` signal (overall diagnostic state) is also compared to `5`.
    *   The results of these two comparisons are fed into an `AND` logical block. This means both the temporary and global states must be `5` for this part of the condition to be true.

2.  **Port Deactivation Check:**
    *   The `LV_PORT_DEAC` signal (port deactivation status) is compared to the constant `0` (presumably meaning "not deactivated").

3.  **Combine Conditions for `CDN_ACT`:**
    *   The output of the state `AND` gate (from step 1) and the result of the `LV_PORT_DEAC` comparison (from step 2) are fed into a second `AND` logical block (V.6.6).
    *   If the output of this `AND` block (`cond_if`) is true, an `If` block (V.6.0) is triggered.
    *   The `true` branch of this `If` block leads to a `Goto` block that sets the `CDN_ACT` (Condition Active) signal. Thus, `CDN_ACT` becomes true if `(if_state_dgo_port_mec_up_tmp == 5 AND [LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP] == 5) AND (LV_PORT_DEAC == 0)`.

4.  **Function Call (`fcn_call`):**
    *   This subsystem also contains an `fcn_call` block. This block represents the execution of the subsystem described in Figure 2.5.14. The `CDN_ACT` signal is implicitly or explicitly the trigger for this function call.
    *   Various input signals (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb`, `V_PORT_AD_OPEN`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`, `V_PORT_I`, `C_V_PORT_AD_OPEN_HYS`, `lf_state_dgo_port_mec_up_tmp`) are passed into this `fcn_call` for processing.
    *   Outputs (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`, `lf_state_dgo_port_mec_up`) are received from the `fcn_call` and propagated as the system's outputs.

### Stage 2: Diagnostic Data Processing (Figure 2.5.14 - `Condition active and not yet de-bounced`)

This subsystem executes when the `fcn_call` (triggered by `CDN_ACT` being true) occurs.

1.  **Mechanical Down Status Update:**
    *   The input signal `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb` is directly used to update the output `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`. An intermediate block `SET_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` suggests a direct assignment or a write to a data store.

2.  **Mechanical Up Status and State Calculation:**
    *   A set of input signals (`V_PORT_AD_OPEN`, `V_PORT_I`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`, `lf_state_dgo_port_mec_up_tmp`, `C_V_PORT_AD_OPEN_HYS`) are fed into a sub-component labeled `CALC_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`.
    *   This `CALC_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` component performs internal calculations based on these inputs.
    *   It then outputs the updated diagnostic status `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` and the updated temporary diagnostic state `lf_state_dgo_port_mec_up`. The specific logic within `CALC_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` is not detailed in this diagram.

In summary, the system first determines if the diagnostic condition for a mechanical up state is relevant and active. If it is, a dedicated function is called to update and calculate the various diagnostic statuses and states using raw feedback values, prior to any debouncing logic.


--- Page 45 ---

The provided image contains two distinct Simulink diagram sections, both contributing to an "AIRM: Port flap actuator diagnosis" system. I will analyze both sections as part of the overall system.

## Function

The primary function of these Simulink diagrams is to implement diagnostic logic for the mechanical 'up' and 'down' states of a port flap actuator. This involves setting or calculating specific diagnostic timers or flags based on feedback values, measured voltages, thresholds, hysteresis, and internal temporary states. The system monitors the actuator's position and triggers or manages diagnostic conditions.

## Inputs

**Common/Overall Inputs:**

*   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb**: Feedback value of the diagnostic timer/flag for the 'mechanical down' state.
*   **C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN**: A constant value used to set the 'mechanical down' diagnostic timer/flag.
*   **V_PORT_i**: Instantaneous voltage input, likely representing the physical position or status of the port flap (e.g., from a position sensor).
*   **V_PORT_AD_OPEN**: An Analog-to-Digital (AD) threshold voltage representing the 'open' state of the flap.
*   **C_V_PORT_AD_OPEN_HYS**: A constant hysteresis voltage value applied to the `V_PORT_AD_OPEN` threshold to prevent rapid switching.
*   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb**: Feedback value of the diagnostic timer/flag for the 'mechanical up' state.
*   **LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_tmp**: A temporary internal diagnostic state variable related to the 'mechanical up' mechanism.
*   **C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP**: A constant value used to set or reset the 'mechanical up' diagnostic timer/flag.

## Outputs

**Common/Overall Outputs:**

*   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN**: The calculated diagnostic timer/flag for the 'mechanical down' state (written to a Data Store).
*   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP**: The calculated diagnostic timer/flag for the 'mechanical up' state (written to a Data Store).
*   **If_state_dgo_port_mec_up**: An intermediate diagnostic state variable related to the 'mechanical up' mechanism (written to a Data Store).

## Logic Flow

The logic is split into two main sections:

### Section 1: SET T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN (Figure 2.5.15)

1.  **Feedback Check:** The current value of `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb` is checked if it is not equal (`!=`) to `0`.
2.  **Conditional Assignment:**
    *   If `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb` is NOT `0` (meaning the 'down' timer/flag is active or not in its default state), then the `cond_if` block's 'if' path is activated.
    *   The output `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` is set to the constant value `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`. This likely serves to reset the timer, or set a specific diagnostic flag value when the condition is met.
    *   (The 'else' path is not explicitly shown leading to an output, implying that if `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb` IS `0`, the output variable might retain its value or be controlled by other parts of the system.)

### Section 2: Calculate T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP (Figure 2.5.16)

1.  **Calculate Hysteresis Threshold:** The `V_PORT_AD_OPEN` threshold is added to the `C_V_PORT_AD_OPEN_HYS` hysteresis value. This sum creates an 'open' detection threshold with a built-in buffer.
2.  **Primary Flap Position Check:** The instantaneous port voltage `V_PORT_i` is compared to the calculated hysteresis threshold using a 'less than' (`<`) operator.
    *   **IF `V_PORT_i` is LESS THAN the threshold (Condition TRUE - indicative of 'open' state or movement towards 'open'):**
        *   The feedback value `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb` is passed through a `40ms` delay block.
        *   This delayed value is then passed as the intermediate diagnostic timer value (`[t_port_diag_mec_up]`). (The `+0` block is redundant and implies direct passing of the delayed value).
    *   **ELSE (`V_PORT_i` is GREATER THAN or EQUAL TO the threshold - Condition FALSE - indicative of 'closed' state or movement towards 'closed'):**
        *   A secondary condition is evaluated: `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_tmp` is checked if it is equal (`==`) to `0`.
            *   **IF `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_tmp` IS `0` (Secondary Condition TRUE):**
                *   The intermediate diagnostic timer value (`[t_port_diag_mec_up]`) is set to the constant `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`. This likely acts as a reset or a fixed initial value for the timer under this condition.
            *   **ELSE (`LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_tmp` is NOT `0` - Secondary Condition FALSE):**
                *   The intermediate diagnostic timer value (`[t_port_diag_mec_up]`) is set to `1`. This could represent a specific diagnostic flag or state.
3.  **Merge and Update Outputs:** The final calculated `[t_port_diag_mec_up]` value (determined by the conditional logic above) is then used to update two output variables via `Merge` blocks:
    *   The value is assigned to `If_state_dgo_port_mec_up` (Data Store Write block labeled '2').
    *   The value is also assigned to `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` (Data Store Write block labeled '1').

The provided image displays two distinct Simulink diagrams, both related to the "AIRM: Port flap actuator diagnosis".

## Function

These Simulink diagrams implement diagnostic logic for a port flap actuator, specifically managing "mechanical up" and "mechanical down" states or fault timers.

1.  **Set T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP (Figure 2.5.20):** This block's primary function is to set or update a diagnostic timer/flag, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`, based on a feedback signal. It essentially activates or resets the "mechanical up" diagnostic timer under a specific condition.
2.  **Calculate T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN (Figure 2.5.21):** This more complex block calculates two main outputs: `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` (a "mechanical down" diagnostic timer/flag) and `if_state_dgo_port_mec_down` (a related diagnostic state flag). It uses voltage thresholds, feedback timers, and another diagnostic state as inputs. It also determines and signals conditions for a higher-level state machine.

## Inputs

The inputs listed are a consolidation from both diagrams, assuming a shared system context for global signals (From/Goto blocks) and constants.

*   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb (From block 1):** Feedback or current value of the "mechanical up" diagnostic timer/flag.
*   **C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP (From block V.6.4):** A constant defining the target or reset value for the "mechanical up" diagnostic timer/flag.
*   **V_PORT_I (From block 3):** Analog input representing the current voltage or position of the port.
*   **V_PORT_AD_CLOSE_I (From block 4):** A voltage threshold value representing the "port close" condition.
*   **C_V_PORT_AD_CLOSE_HYS (From block 5):** A hysteresis value applied to the "port close" voltage threshold.
*   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb (From block 2):** Feedback or current value of the "mechanical down" diagnostic timer/flag.
*   **LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_tmp (From block 4, labeled "Check == 0"):** A temporary or intermediate state flag related to the "mechanical down" diagnosis.
*   **C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN (From block V.6.4):** A constant defining the target or set value for the "mechanical down" diagnostic timer/flag.
*   **Constant '0' (From block V.6.4):** Used for comparison.
*   **Constant '1' (From block V.6.4):** Used for assignment in the "else" branch.
*   **Constant '40ms' (From block V.6.5):** A time threshold (0.04 seconds) for comparison with `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb`.
*   **[t_port_diag_mec_down] (From Goto1 in Figure 2.5.21):** A global signal, likely an intermediate diagnostic timer or state value.
*   **[else] (From Goto0 in Figure 2.5.21):** A global signal, likely a default value or alternative state for `if_state_dgo_port_mec_down`.

## Outputs

*   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP (To block 1):** The calculated "mechanical up" diagnostic timer/flag.
*   **if_state_dgo_port_mec_down (To block 1):** A binary or state flag indicating a specific condition related to the "mechanical down" diagnosis.
*   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN (To block 2):** The calculated "mechanical down" diagnostic timer/flag.
*   **Goto4 (From block V.6.0 in Figure 2.5.21):** A global signal indicating that `V_PORT_I` is greater than the adjusted port close threshold.
*   **Goto5 (From block V.6.0 in Figure 2.5.21):** A global signal indicating that `V_PORT_I` is not greater than the adjusted port close threshold (the "else" condition).

## Logic Flow

The logical flow is described for each diagram separately:

### 1. Set T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP (Figure 2.5.20)

1.  The incoming feedback signal, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`, is compared against `0` using a "not equal" (`!=`) operator (V.6.2).
2.  The boolean result of this comparison (`cond_if`) is fed into an "If" block (V.6.0).
3.  **If `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb != 0` is true:**
    *   The "if" branch is activated.
    *   The output `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` is set to the constant value `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`.
4.  **If `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb != 0` is false:**
    *   The "else" branch is implicitly taken. The diagram does not explicitly show an assignment for `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` in this case, suggesting it might retain its previous value or be handled by a default merge input in a larger system context.

### 2. Calculate T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN (Figure 2.5.21)

This diagram has two main parts: an initial condition check and the primary diagnostic calculations.

**A. Initial Voltage Condition Check (Top Branch):**
1.  `V_PORT_AD_CLOSE_I` and `C_V_PORT_AD_CLOSE_HYS` are summed (V.7.2) to determine an adjusted port close voltage threshold.
2.  The input `V_PORT_I` is compared with this adjusted threshold using a "greater than" (`>`) operator (V.6.2).
3.  The boolean result feeds into an "If" block (V.6.0).
4.  **If `V_PORT_I > (V_PORT_AD_CLOSE_I + C_V_PORT_AD_CLOSE_HYS)` is true:** The `Goto4` global signal is activated, indicating this condition to other parts of the system.
5.  **If the condition is false:** The `Goto5` global signal is activated, indicating the alternative condition.

**B. Main Diagnostic Timer/Flag Calculation (Lower Branches):**
This section determines `if_state_dgo_port_mec_down` and `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`.

1.  **Primary Condition (`Main_If_Condition`) Calculation:**
    *   A comparison checks if `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb` is less than or equal to `40ms` (V.6.5). Let this result be `Cond_Timer`.
    *   Another comparison checks if `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_tmp` is equal to `0` (V.6.4). The result is then inverted (V.6.4 inverter). Let this inverted result be `Cond_State_Inv` (i.e., `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_tmp != 0`).
    *   `Cond_Timer` and `Cond_State_Inv` are combined using a logical `AND` gate (V.7.2). This forms the `Main_If_Condition`: `(T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb <= 40ms) AND (LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_tmp != 0)`.

2.  **Calculate `if_state_dgo_port_mec_down` (Output 1):**
    *   An "If" block (V.6.0) uses `Main_If_Condition`.
    *   **If `Main_If_Condition` is true:** The output `if_state_dgo_port_mec_down` is set to the value of the global signal `[t_port_diag_mec_down]` (received via a `From` block corresponding to `Goto1`).
    *   **If `Main_If_Condition` is false:** The output `if_state_dgo_port_mec_down` is set to the value of the global signal `[else]` (received via a `From` block corresponding to `Goto0`).

3.  **Calculate `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` (Output 2):**
    *   Another "If" block (V.6.0) also uses `Main_If_Condition`.
    *   **If `Main_If_Condition` is true:** The output `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` is set to the constant value `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` (from V.6.4).
    *   **If `Main_If_Condition` is false:** The output `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` is set to the constant value `1` (from V.6.4).

This image displays a Simulink diagram, which is a visual programming environment for modeling, simulating, and analyzing dynamic systems.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to perform **Port Flap Over-Travel Diagnosis**. Specifically, it analyzes conditions for both "down over-travel" and "up over-travel" of a port flap actuator, likely in an automotive system (indicated by "AIRM. Port flap actuator diagnosis"). It processes various input signals to determine diagnostic status, fault states, and memorized position values related to the flap's position and control.

## Inputs
The diagram receives a comprehensive set of input signals, including:

*   **Timing/Calibration Signals:**
    *   `<T_AST>`: Absolute system time.
    *   `<TIA_IM>`: Time interval.
    *   `<TCO>`: Counter or timer value.
*   **Port Position/Control Signals:**
    *   `<LV_PORT_DEAC>`: Port deactivation status.
    *   `<V_PORT_i>`: Current port position/voltage.
    *   `<V_PORT_MEM_i>`: Memorized port position/voltage (input for initialization or feedback).
*   **Error/Feedback Signals for Down Over-Travel:**
    *   `<NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER_i>`: Error flag for 'down over-travel' (e.g., fault identification).
    *   `<NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER_i>`: Index error flag for 'down over-travel'.
    *   `<T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER_fb>`: Feedback of the 'down over-travel' diagnostic result (likely a previous state).
*   **Error/Feedback Signals for Up Over-Travel:**
    *   `<NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER_i>`: Error flag for 'up over-travel'.
    *   `<NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER_i>`: Index error flag for 'up over-travel'.
    *   `<T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_i>`: Diagnostic result input for 'up over-travel' (possibly previous state or initialization).
*   **General Action/Error Management:**
    *   `<ACTION_FARM_GetPermission_T3>`: Permission signal from a fault management system.
    *   `<ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag>`: Error management result for diagnosis.

(Note: `LV_V_PORT_MEM_i` appears twice in the input list, implying it's a common input fed to both diagnostic paths.)

## Outputs
The diagram produces the following outputs:

*   `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`: The calculated diagnostic result for the 'down over-travel' condition.
*   `LV_V_PORT_MEM`: Latched or memorized port position value (specific to down over-travel).
*   `V_PORT_MEM`: Memorized port position value (specific to down over-travel).
*   `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER`: A fault state or flag indicating a detected 'down over-travel' condition.
*   `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`: The calculated diagnostic result for the 'up over-travel' condition.
*   `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER`: A fault state or flag indicating a detected 'up over-travel' condition.

## Logic Flow
The logical flow of the diagram is as follows:

1.  **Input Distribution:** All input signals are received by the main subsystem. They are then routed to one of two identical-looking diagnostic sub-systems (or Model Reference blocks), identified as `DIAG_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER` (X.2.1.1.4.1) and `DIAG_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` (X.2.1.1.4.2). Common signals like timing, general actions, and memorized port values (`LV_V_PORT_MEM_i`, `V_PORT_MEM_i`) are sent to both blocks. Specific error flags and feedback are routed to their respective 'down' or 'up' diagnostic blocks.

2.  **Parallel Diagnostic Processing:**
    *   **`DIAG_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER` (X.2.1.1.4.1):** This block performs the diagnostic logic for the port flap moving too far in the 'down' direction. It takes its specific inputs (e.g., `NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER_fb`) along with the common inputs. It then calculates and outputs the diagnostic status (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`), memorized port states (`LV_V_PORT_MEM`, `V_PORT_MEM`), and a fault state (`LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER`).
    *   **`DIAG_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` (X.2.1.1.4.2):** This block operates in parallel, performing the diagnostic logic for the port flap moving too far in the 'up' direction. It receives its specific 'up' inputs (e.g., `NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_fb`) and the common inputs. It outputs its diagnostic status (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`) and a fault state (`LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER`). Notably, the `LV_V_PORT_MEM` and `V_PORT_MEM` outputs are not directly routed from this 'up_over' block to the global outputs, suggesting they might be internal to the block or only relevant for the 'down_over' condition at the top level.

3.  **Output Consolidation (Up_Over Diagnostic Result):** The `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` signal has a special handling. Two signals originating from the `DIAG_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` block – `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` and `<T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER>` – are fed into a `Merge1` block. In Simulink, a Merge block typically combines signals from mutually exclusive execution paths (e.g., from an If-Else block or Enabled Subsystem) into a single output. While the exact reason for two inputs from the same source block to `Merge1` is not explicitly visible (it could imply internal conditional logic within the `DIAG_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` model reference itself, or a default/current value selection), its function here is to produce a single `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` signal as a final output.

4.  **Global Output Export:** All the resulting diagnostic statuses, fault states, and relevant memorized values from both parallel paths are then output from the main subsystem to the rest of the control system.

## Function
This Simulink diagram implements a diagnostic logic for an automotive "Port Flap Actuator," specifically focusing on an "Over-travel check lower stop" condition. Its primary function is to determine if certain pre-conditions and operational thresholds are met to activate a specific diagnostic procedure (`CDN_ACT`). Based on this activation, it calls different functions to update diagnostic states and error flags related to the port's mechanical overtravel and long-term failure status. It also manages error reporting.

## Inputs
1.  **ACTION_FARM_GetPermission**: Boolean signal, permission to "farm" data or initiate an action.
2.  **NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER**: Boolean signal, indicates absence of a fault ID error for port mechanical down overtravel.
3.  **T_AST**: Numerical signal, likely an actual measured value (e.g., temperature, position).
4.  **TIA_IM**: Numerical signal, likely an immediate actual value or current.
5.  **TCO**: Numerical signal, likely a calculated or observed overtravel count/value.
6.  **LV_PORT_DEAC**: Numerical signal, representing the port deactivation level.
7.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER_fb**: Numerical feedback signal, the current diagnostic state of port mechanical down overtravel.
8.  **V_PORT_J**: Numerical signal, likely a measured voltage or value for port J.
9.  **ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag**: Boolean signal, permission to report diagnostic error results.
10. **NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER**: Numerical signal, a specific index for the port mechanical down overtravel error.
11. **PRM_LV_PRMS**: Parameter, represents level parameters or permissions, used by the `ActionImport` block.
12. **C_T_AST_MIN_PORT_DIAG**: Constant, minimum threshold for `T_AST` for port diagnosis.
13. **C_TIA_MIN_DIAG_PORT_MEC_OVER**: Constant, minimum threshold for `TIA_IM` for port mechanical overtravel diagnosis.
14. **C_TCO_MIN_DIAG_PORT_MEC_OVER**: Constant, minimum threshold for `TCO` for port mechanical overtravel diagnosis.
15. **Constant `1`**: Numerical constant `1`, used for comparison.

## Outputs
1.  **CDN_ACT**: Boolean signal, indicates if the primary diagnostic condition is active.
2.  **NO_CDN_ACT**: Boolean signal, indicates if the primary diagnostic condition is NOT active.
3.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER**: Numerical signal, the updated diagnostic state for port mechanical UP overtravel.
4.  **LV_V_PORT_MEM**: Numerical signal, updated memory level for port voltage.
5.  **V_PORT_MEM**: Numerical signal, updated memory value for port voltage.
6.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER**: Numerical signal, the updated diagnostic state for port mechanical DOWN overtravel.
7.  **LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER**: Numerical signal, the updated long-term failure diagnosis state for port mechanical down overtravel.
8.  **PRM_STATE_FIL**: Numerical signal, a filtered parameter state or flag related to error diagnosis.

## Logic Flow

The logic flow can be broken down into three main stages:

1.  **Activation Condition Determination**:
    *   An `ActionImport` block named `PRM_LV_PRMS` receives `ACTION_FARM_GetPermission`. This block likely evaluates internal parameters or conditions based on this input to produce a permission signal.
    *   The input `NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER` directly participates in the activation logic.
    *   Several comparison checks are performed:
        *   `T_AST` is checked if it's greater than `C_T_AST_MIN_PORT_DIAG`.
        *   `TIA_IM` is checked if it's greater than `C_TIA_MIN_DIAG_PORT_MEC_OVER`.
        *   `TCO` is checked if it's greater than `C_TCO_MIN_DIAG_PORT_MEC_OVER`.
        *   `LV_PORT_DEAC` is checked if it is equal to the constant `1`.
    *   The outputs from the `PRM_LV_PRMS` `ActionImport` block, `NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER`, and the results of the five comparison operations are all fed into a single `AND` gate.
    *   The output of this `AND` gate, representing the combined activation logic, is then fed into an `If` block.
    *   The `If` block creates two exclusive execution paths:
        *   If the `AND` condition is true, a `Goto` block outputs `CDN_ACT`.
        *   If the `AND` condition is false, a `Goto` block outputs `NO_CDN_ACT`.

2.  **Conditional Diagnostic State Updates**:
    *   Two `Fcn_call` blocks are used, representing different functions executed conditionally.
    *   **If `CDN_ACT` is true (diagnostic condition active)**:
        *   The `Fcn_call` block `X.2.1.1.4.1.1` is executed.
        *   It takes inputs: `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` (previous value), `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER_fb` (feedback of down overtravel state), `LV_V_PORT_MEM` (previous memory level), `V_PORT_MEM` (previous memory value), and `V_PORT_J`.
        *   This function calculates and outputs the updated `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`, `LV_V_PORT_MEM`, `V_PORT_MEM` (which become diagram outputs), and intermediate values for `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` and `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER`.
    *   **If `NO_CDN_ACT` is true (diagnostic condition not active)**:
        *   The `Fcn_call` block `X.2.1.1.4.1.2` is executed.
        *   It takes inputs: `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` (previous value for this path) and `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER` (previous long-term failure state).
        *   This function calculates and outputs its versions of `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` and `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER`.
    *   The `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` outputs from both `Fcn_call` paths are combined by a `Merge` block to produce the final `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` output of the diagram.
    *   Similarly, the `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER` outputs from both `Fcn_call` paths are combined by a `Merge2` block to produce the final `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER` output of the diagram.

3.  **Error Result Management**:
    *   `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag` and `NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER` are fed into an `ActionImport` block named `PRM_STATE_DGO`.
    *   This block processes these inputs to determine `PRM_IDX_ERR` (parameter index error) and `PRM_STATE_DGO` (parameter state diagnosis).
    *   The final output of this section, `PRM_STATE_FIL` (filtered parameter state), is passed out of the diagram to an external subsystem.


--- Page 52 ---

This image displays a Simulink (or similar block diagram notation) representation, likely illustrating a component of an automotive diagnostic system.

## Function
The primary function of this diagram, in the context of "AIRM. Port flap actuator diagnosis" and "Invalid condition," is to evaluate the validity or contribution of specific diagnostic thresholds to a logical fault state for a port flap actuator's mechanical "down/over" condition. It appears to determine if the configured diagnostic parameters themselves constitute an "invalid condition" which affects the overall diagnostic status.

## Inputs
1.  **`fcn_call`**: This likely represents an event trigger or a function call input that initiates the evaluation of the logic within this subsystem. It signals when the diagnostic condition should be assessed.
2.  **`0`**: A constant numerical input with a value of zero. This is used for comparison, specifically with the counter threshold.
3.  **`C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`**: This input is a configurable counter threshold related to the mechanical "down/over" diagnosis of the port flap. "C_T" typically stands for "Counter Threshold". Its value is checked against the constant `0`.
4.  **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`**: This input is a configurable timer threshold related to the mechanical "down/over" diagnosis of the port flap. "T" typically stands for "Timer". Its value directly influences the diagnostic output.

## Outputs
1.  **`LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER`**: This is the primary output, representing the "Logical Fault State, Diagnostic Good/Ongoing" for the port flap's mechanical "down/over" condition. This signal indicates whether a diagnostic fault for this condition is active, potentially due to an invalid configuration or a real mechanical issue.

## Logic Flow

The diagram illustrates the dependencies of the `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER` output on the input parameters, particularly in the context of an "invalid condition."

1.  **Trigger Event**: The logic is activated or evaluated upon a `fcn_call` event. This suggests a periodic or event-driven execution of this diagnostic check.

2.  **Counter Threshold Validity Check**:
    *   The constant `0` is compared with the input `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`. In diagnostic systems, if a counter threshold is configured as `0`, it often means that the counter-based part of the diagnosis is either disabled or considered invalid.
    *   If `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` is found to be `0` (or some other implicitly invalid value), this condition is flagged. This "invalidity" directly contributes to the determination of the overall fault state.

3.  **Timer Threshold Contribution**:
    *   The input `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` (timer threshold) is also fed into the logic that determines `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER`.
    *   While not explicitly shown with a comparison to `0` like the counter threshold, it is highly probable that `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` also undergoes a validity check (e.g., if it's `0` or below a minimum meaningful duration). Its value, whether valid or invalid, contributes to the final diagnostic fault state.

4.  **Fault State Determination**:
    *   The results from the counter threshold validity check (i.e., whether `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` is `0`) and the status derived from `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` are combined.
    *   If an "invalid condition" is detected based on these thresholds (e.g., a threshold is set to `0` when it should be positive), or if the thresholds, when valid, indicate a persistent mechanical "down/over" state, the `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_DOWN_OVER` output is set accordingly to signal a diagnostic fault or an invalid diagnostic configuration.

This is a Simulink diagram.

## Function
This Simulink diagram, titled "Over-travel check upper stop" and associated with "AIRM. Port flap actuator diagnosis", performs a diagnostic function. Its primary purpose is to:
1.  Evaluate a set of conditions related to port flap actuator operation (including timers, deactivation status, and memory values, along with system permissions).
2.  Determine if a conditional diagnostic action (`CDN_ACT`) or a non-conditional action (`NO_CDN_ACT`) should be triggered based on these evaluations.

*   `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag`: Control signal to trigger error result diagnostics.
*   `NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER`: "No index error" indicator for the port mechanical upper overtravel.

## Outputs
The key outputs from this system are:
*   `(CDN_ACT)`: A signal indicating that a conditional diagnostic action should be taken (used as a `Goto` tag).
*   `(NO_CDN_ACT)`: A signal indicating that no conditional diagnostic action should be taken (used as a `Goto` tag).
*   `<T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER>`: The updated status or timer value for the port mechanical upper overtravel diagnostic.
*   `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER`: The final diagnostic state object for the port mechanical upper overtravel (e.g., Fault, OK, Pre-fault).
*   `PRM_STATE_FIL`: A filtered state parameter, likely for error reporting or logging.
*   `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag`: The processed or forwarded error result diagnostic action signal.

## Logic Flow
The logical flow of the diagram can be broken down into three main sections:

1.  **Diagnostic Condition Evaluation (Top Section):**
    *   **Permissions and Fault Status:** An `ActionImport` block (`PRM_LV_PRMS`) takes `ACTION_FARM_GetPermission`, `PRM_FID`, and `NC_FID_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` as inputs. This block likely determines if the diagnostic check is permitted and if there's no existing mechanical overtravel fault, outputting a boolean permission/status signal.
    *   **Timer/Threshold Comparisons:**
        *   `T_AST` is compared against `C_T_AST_MIN_PORT_DIAG` using a `>` (greater than) comparator.
        *   `TIA_IM` is compared against `C_TIA_MIN_DIAG_PORT_MEC_OVER` using a `>` comparator.
        *   `TCO` is compared against `C_TCO_MIN_DIAG_PORT_MEC_OVER` using a `>` comparator.
    *   **Deactivation and Memory Checks:**
        *   `LV_PORT_DEAC` is checked for equality with `0` (meaning the port is active).
        *   `LV_V_PORT_MEM_I` is checked for equality with `1`.
    *   **AND Gate:** The boolean output from the `PRM_LV_PRMS` block and the results of all five comparison/equality checks are fed into an `AND` gate. This means all six conditions must be TRUE for the diagnostic condition to be met.
    *   **Conditional Branching (`if-else`):** The output of the `AND` gate drives an `if-else` block:
        *   If the `AND` gate output is TRUE, the `if` branch is activated, leading to a `Goto` tag `(CDN_ACT)`.
        *   If the `AND` gate output is FALSE, the `else` branch is activated, leading to a `Goto` tag `(NO_CDN_ACT)`.

2.  **Diagnostic State Management (Middle Section):**
    *   **`CDN_ACT` Function Call:** If `(CDN_ACT)` is active, an `fcn_call()` block is executed. This block takes `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_fb`, `V_PORT_I`, and `V_PORT_MEM_I` as inputs and computes `<T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER>` (updated diagnostic timer/status) and `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` (the diagnostic state object).
    *   **`NO_CDN_ACT` Function Call:** If `(NO_CDN_ACT)` is active, a separate `fcn_call()` block is executed (likely the same function or a related one in a "no action" context). This block also computes `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER`.
    *   **Merge:** The `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` outputs from both `fcn_call()` blocks are combined by a `Merge` block to produce a single, continuous `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` output for the entire subsystem.

3.  **Error Reporting Configuration (Bottom Section):**
    *   **Error Reporting Action:** `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag` and `NC_IDX_ERR_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` (No Index Error) serve as inputs to an `ActionImport` block. This block, labeled with `PRM_IDX_ERR`, `PRM_STATE_FIL`, and `PRM_STATE_DGO`, processes these inputs to configure or update error reporting parameters.
    *   **Output:** The block outputs `PRM_STATE_FIL` and the (potentially modified or forwarded) `ACTION_ERRM_ResultDiag` signal, indicating the status of the error reporting action.

This image contains two distinct Simulink diagrams. The primary diagram for analysis, based on its prominent placement and title, is "2.5.2.1.1.4.2.1 Valid condition".

## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to evaluate and update the diagnostic state (`LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER`) of a port flap actuator and generate a condition flag (`[CDN]`). It integrates a time-based counter for specific event detection (signaled by `[CDN]`) and a function-based calculation of the diagnostic state, which is then merged with a previous state. This system likely monitors the health or operational status of a port flap within an automotive system, possibly related to emissions control or air intake management.

## Inputs

1.  **`fcn_call`**: A trigger signal that initiates the execution of the main logic block.
2.  **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_fb`**: A feedback value representing the previous state of a diagnostic timer or counter. This serves as the initial value for the current timer calculation.
3.  **`V_PORT_i`**: The current measured value of the port, likely a sensor reading reflecting its position or state.
4.  **`V_PORT_MEM_i`**: A memorized or previous measured value of the port, used for comparison or historical analysis.
5.  **`LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` (from `From` block connected to `Goto2`)**: The previous or default diagnostic state of the port flap, used as one of the inputs to the `Merge` block. (Note: The diagram also shows a feedback path where this signal is scaled by 5 and fed back to `Goto2`, implying its previous value is used or transformed).

## Outputs

1.  **`[CDN]`**: A Boolean condition flag, indicating that the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` timer/counter has just transitioned from a positive value to zero.
2.  **`LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER`**: The calculated or updated diagnostic state of the port flap actuator. This is the main output representing the current diagnostic status.

## Logic Flow

The diagram's logic is primarily divided into two parallel processing paths, both typically executed when `fcn_call` is active, and their results contribute to the overall system state.

1.  **Timer-based Condition Flag (`[CDN]`) Calculation:**
    *   **Timer Increment:** The signal `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` is continuously calculated. In a loop, it receives `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_fb` (which is the previous value of `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` delayed by `40ms`) and adds `1` to it using the `Sum` block (`V.7.2`). This forms a self-incrementing timer/counter that increments its value by 1 every 40 milliseconds when `fcn_call` is active.
    *   **Condition Check:** The logic then performs two key comparisons on the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` signal:
        *   An `Equal To Zero` comparison (`== 0`, V.6.2) checks if the *current* `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` value is zero.
        *   A `Greater Than` comparison (`> 0`, V.6.2) checks if the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` value from the *previous* sample time was greater than zero. This "previous sample" value is obtained using a Unit Delay block (`1/z Init = 0`).
    *   **`[CDN]` Output:** The results of these two comparisons are fed into an `AND` logical operator (`V.6.6`). The output `[CDN]` (routed via `Goto1`) becomes true only if both conditions are met. This means `[CDN]` is true precisely when the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` counter has just transitioned from a positive value to zero, effectively acting as a "timer expired" or "event completion" detection flag.

2.  **Diagnostic State (`LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER`) Calculation and Update:**
    *   **State Calculation:** An embedded function block named `CALC_V_PORT_MEM` (referenced as `X.2.1.1.4.2.1.1`) takes `V_PORT_i` (current port value) and `V_PORT_MEM_i` (memorized port value) as its inputs. It processes these inputs according to its internal logic (not detailed in this diagram) to compute a new `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER`.
    *   **State Merging/Selection:** A `Merge` block (`Merge1`) acts as a selector for the final `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` output. It receives two potential values:
        *   The newly calculated `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` from the `CALC_V_PORT_MEM` function block.
        *   The previous or default `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` (received via a `From` block that typically links to a `Goto2` block, suggesting a feedback of the last known state).
    *   In a typical setup involving `Merge` blocks with conditional execution, if `CALC_V_PORT_MEM` is actively computing a new state (e.g., when `fcn_call` is true), its output is selected. Otherwise, the previous/default state is maintained.

This combined logic allows the system to continuously update the port's diagnostic state based on current and historical measurements, while also providing a precise time-based flag (`[CDN]`) for specific events or conditions that might rely on a timer's expiration.


--- Page 55 ---

This image presents two related but distinct Simulink/Stateflow diagrams pertaining to "AIRM: Port flap actuator diagnosis." The primary and more complex diagram is "CLR_RST" (Figure 2.5.31), which will be the focus of this analysis. The top diagram (Figure 2.5.30) shows a specific "Invalid condition."

## Function (CLR_RST Diagram)

The primary function of the "CLR_RST" (Clear Reset) diagram is to aggregate and bundle various diagnostic states, reset requests, and action signals related to a "Port flap actuator" into a single output bus. This module likely serves as an interface for a higher-level diagnostic or fault management system, providing a comprehensive status and control interface for clearing or resetting fault conditions associated with the actuator's movement (down, up, and respective 'over' conditions which typically imply an overload or over-current).

## Inputs (CLR_RST Diagram)

The "CLR_RST" system takes the following inputs:

1.  **feedback (Port 1):** A general feedback signal, likely used as an enabling condition or a state input for the internal diagnostic logic. It is distributed to all four sub-logic blocks.
2.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN:** A diagnostic flag indicating a fault or state condition related to the port flap actuator moving down.
3.  **ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecDn:** A command or flag to request a reset of the diagnostics specific to the port flap mechanism moving down.
4.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP:** A diagnostic flag indicating a fault or state condition related to the port flap actuator moving up.
5.  **ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecUp:** A command or flag to request a reset of the diagnostics specific to the port flap mechanism moving up.
6.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER:** A diagnostic flag indicating an 'over' condition (e.g., over-current, over-temperature) related to the port flap actuator moving down.
7.  **LV_V_PORT_MEM (from X.3.3):** A local variable or memory state related to the 'down over' diagnostic condition.
8.  **ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeDnO:** A command or flag to request a reset of the diagnostics specific to the port flap mechanism moving down with an 'over' condition.
9.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER:** A diagnostic flag indicating an 'over' condition related to the port flap actuator moving up.
10. **LV_V_PORT_MEM (from X.3.4):** A local variable or memory state related to the 'up over' diagnostic condition.
11. **ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeUpO:** A command or flag to request a reset of the diagnostics specific to the port flap mechanism moving up with an 'over' condition.

## Outputs (CLR_RST Diagram)

1.  **CLR_RST (Port 1):** This is the main output. It is a single bus that encapsulates all the processed diagnostic and reset-related signals listed below. This bus likely provides a structured data interface to other parts of the system.
    *   `ActionExport` (from X.3.1, X.3.2, X.3.3, X.3.4)
    *   `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`
    *   `ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecDn`
    *   `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`
    *   `ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecUp`
    *   `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`
    *   `LV_V_PORT_MEM` (the merged signal)
    *   `ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeDnO`
    *   `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`
    *   `ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeUpO`

## Logic Flow (CLR_RST Diagram)

The "CLR_RST" diagram processes diagnostic and reset information through a parallel structure and then aggregates it:

1.  **Distributed Feedback:** The common `feedback` input signal is fanned out and provided to four distinct logical units (labeled X.3.1, X.3.2, X.3.3, X.3.4). These units represent specific diagnostic logic paths, likely Stateflow charts or subsystems, each focusing on a different aspect of the port flap actuator's operation.
2.  **Parallel Diagnostic Processing:**
    *   **Unit X.3.1 (Port Mec Down):** Processes the `feedback` signal, the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` flag, and the `ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecDn` reset request. It generates an `ActionExport` signal and passes through the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` and `ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecDn` signals to the output aggregation.
    *   **Unit X.3.2 (Port Mec Up):** Similarly, it handles `feedback`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`, and `ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecUp`, outputting its own `ActionExport` and passing through the relevant diagnostic and reset signals.
    *   **Unit X.3.3 (Port Mec Down Over):** Focuses on the 'down over' condition, taking `feedback`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`, an instance of `LV_V_PORT_MEM`, and `ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeDnO`. It outputs its `ActionExport` and the specific diagnostic/reset signals.
    *   **Unit X.3.4 (Port Mec Up Over):** Handles the 'up over' condition, taking `feedback`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`, another instance of `LV_V_PORT_MEM`, and `ACTIONDEF_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeUpO`. It outputs its `ActionExport` and the specific diagnostic/reset signals.
3.  **Memory Signal Merging:** The two `LV_V_PORT_MEM` signals (one from X.3.3 and one from X.3.4) are fed into a `Merge` block. In Simulink/Stateflow, a `Merge` block is typically used to combine signals that originate from mutually exclusive paths (e.g., different active states in a Stateflow chart), ensuring that only one active signal contributes to the output at any given time, or to simply combine signals into a single output line. The output of this block is a single `LV_V_PORT_MEM` signal.
4.  **Output Bus Creation:** All the individual output signals from the four processing units (X.3.1-X.3.4), including their respective `ActionExport` signals, diagnostic flags, reset requests, and the merged `LV_V_PORT_MEM` signal, are then connected to a vertical bar block, which acts as a Bus Creator. This block bundles all these discrete signals into a single, structured output bus named `CLR_RST`. This `CLR_RST` bus thus provides a consolidated view of all relevant diagnostic and reset states for the port flap actuator.

---

**Note on Figure 2.5.30 (Invalid Condition):**
This diagram shows a simple logic block. When a `fcn_call` is triggered or active, the diagnostic state variable `LF_STATE_DGO_PORT_MEC_UP_OVER` is set to `0` (presumably meaning 'false' or 'inactive'). This indicates that under certain 'invalid conditions' (as defined by `fcn_call`), the diagnostic flag for the "Port Mechanical Up Over" state is explicitly cleared or disabled. This serves as a related but separate piece of logic that can influence one of the diagnostic states processed by the "CLR_RST" diagram.


--- Page 56 ---

This image contains two related Simulink-like block diagrams, Figure 2.532 and Figure 2.533, which together describe aspects of an "AIRM: Port flap actuator diagnosis" system. They detail how a diagnostic status `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` is managed under different conditions, specifically for resetting and handling failure memory clear or new driving cycle events.

---

### Figure 2.532: ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecDn

**## Function**
This diagram describes an "action" or function responsible for resetting the diagnostic status of a mechanical port (likely an actuator flap) when it is detected to be in a "down" state. It takes initial state and configuration parameters, along with feedback on the current diagnostic status, to produce an updated diagnostic output.

**## Inputs**
1.  **ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecDn_T3 (Trigger)**: A trigger signal originating from an "ACTION_CREATOR" block, initiating the action. The "_T3" suffix often denotes a specific timing or event.
2.  **PRM_STATE_INI**: An initial state parameter, referenced as "V.5.7".
3.  **PRM_NR_CONF**: A configuration parameter (e.g., related to the number of resets or failures), also referenced as "V.5.7".
4.  **<T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN> (Feedback)**: The current or previous diagnostic status of the mechanical port, fed back into the system to influence the reset logic.

**## Outputs**
1.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN**: The updated diagnostic status, indicating whether the mechanical port is confirmed in the 'down' state, referenced as "V.5.3". This signal is also used as feedback.

**## Logic Flow**
1.  **Trigger Activation**: The `ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecDn_T3` signal acts as a trigger, activating the internal processing block labeled "X.3.1.1" (which is effectively a triggered subsystem or function).
2.  **Input Parameters**: Upon activation, the initial state (`PRM_STATE_INI`) and configuration (`PRM_NR_CONF`) parameters are passed into the "X.3.1.1" subsystem.
3.  **Feedback Integration**: The current `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` value is fed back into the "X.3.1.1" subsystem via a labeled feedback path. This allows the reset logic to consider the previous state.
4.  **Internal Processing (X.3.1.1)**: The "X.3.1.1" subsystem processes these inputs to determine the new `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` status. The exact internal logic for resetting or updating the status based on the initial parameters and feedback is encapsulated within this block.
5.  **Output and Recirculation**: The computed `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` is then output from the subsystem. This output is simultaneously fed back, closing the loop and providing the updated status for subsequent executions of this action.

---

### Figure 2.533: PortMecDown diagnosis information in case of failure memory clear (CLR) or new driving cycle (RST)

**## Function**
This diagram details how the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` diagnostic information is handled and updated specifically under two conditions: a system reset (RST), often associated with a new driving cycle, or a failure memory clear (CLR). It selects and combines the appropriate diagnostic status based on these events.

**## Inputs**
1.  **f() (Trigger)**: An implicit trigger (via "ActionImport" and "Trigger" blocks) initiates the diagnostic processing.
2.  **PRM_STATE_INI (x2)**: Two instances of the initial state parameter, one for each (RST and CLR) processing path.
3.  **PRM_NR_CONF (x2)**: Two instances of the configuration parameter, one for each (RST and CLR) processing path.
4.  **<T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN> (x2)**: Two instances of the current diagnostic status (feedback), one for each path.

**## Outputs**
1.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN**: The final, merged diagnostic status of the mechanical port being in the 'down' state, after considering either a reset or a failure memory clear event, referenced as "V.5.3".

**## Logic Flow**
1.  **Trigger and Monitoring**: The system is activated by an implicit trigger 'f()'. A "check scope" block is present, likely for monitoring the input trigger or initial conditions.
2.  **Parallel Processing for RST and CLR**: The inputs (`PRM_STATE_INI`, `PRM_NR_CONF`, and the feedback `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`) are fed into two distinct, parallel processing paths:
    *   **RST Path (X.3.1.1.1)**: This subsystem calculates an intermediate diagnostic feedback value, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb`, specifically for the "RST" (Reset / new driving cycle) condition.
    *   **CLR Path (X.3.1.1.2)**: This subsystem calculates another intermediate diagnostic feedback value, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb`, specifically for the "CLR" (Clear failure memory) condition.
3.  **Merging Results**: The outputs from both parallel paths (the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb` signals) are then fed into a "Merge" block. The "Merge" block is typically used to combine signals from conditionally executed subsystems (e.g., if RST is active, take the RST path output; if CLR is active, take the CLR path output).
4.  **Final Diagnostic Output**: The "Merge" block's output is the final `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` signal, representing the definitive diagnostic status after accounting for either a system reset or a failure memory clear event.


--- Page 57 ---

This image contains two Simulink-like block diagrams (Figure 2.5.34 and Figure 2.5.35) which model logic for "AIRM Port flap actuator diagnosis." They represent the calculation of a diagnostic status under different system states.

## Function

The primary function of these diagrams is to calculate and output the diagnostic status `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN` (likely indicating the "mechanical down" state of a port flap actuator). The calculation is performed based on the current system state (`PRM_STATE_INI`), various configuration parameters (`PRM_NR_CONF`, `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`), and feedback from the diagnostic itself (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb`). Each diagram shows this calculation for a specific operating mode: "RST" (Reset) and "CLR" (Clear), determined by comparing `PRM_STATE_INI` with a constant value.

## Inputs

The key inputs for both diagrams are:

*   **`PRM_STATE_INI`**: An input representing the current system state or initialization status.
*   **`PRM_NR_CONF`**: A parameter or configuration number, likely used for setting a specific diagnostic threshold or value.
*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb`**: Feedback from the existing "mechanical down" diagnostic status, indicating its current value.
*   **`C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`**: A constant value related to the mechanical down diagnosis, potentially a default value or threshold.

## Outputs

The key output for both diagrams is:

*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`**: The calculated diagnostic status for the port flap's "mechanical down" position. This is likely a numerical value or a flag indicating a fault or OK state.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow for both diagrams is structurally identical, differing only in the constant value used for the initial state comparison:

1.  **System State Comparison:**
    *   The `PRM_STATE_INI` input is compared against a specific constant value:
        *   In Figure 2.5.34 (`RST` mode), it's compared with the `REST` constant (value `+1.00000e+000`, V.6.5).
        *   In Figure 2.5.35 (`CLR` mode), it's compared with the `CLR` constant (value `+0.00000e+000`, V.6.5).
    *   This comparison is performed by an equality comparator block (`=`, V.6.2), producing a boolean output (true/false).

2.  **Conditional Logic Activation:**
    *   The boolean result from the equality comparison is fed into a "cond_if" block (V.6.0). This block acts as a conditional logic trigger.
    *   The output of the "cond_if" block serves as the control signal (selection index) for a subsequent Multiport Switch block (`V.7.10`). (There's also a dashed line output from `cond_if` which might indicate an alternative path or an "else" condition not fully elaborated in this diagram's scope for `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`).

3.  **Data Selection:**
    *   A Multiport Switch block (`V.7.10`) receives three data inputs:
        *   `PRM_NR_CONF`
        *   `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`
        *   `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_fb`
    *   Based on the selection index provided by the "cond_if" block, the Multiport Switch selects one of these three input values and passes it as its output.

4.  **Value Inversion:**
    *   The selected value from the Multiport Switch (`V.7.10`) is then passed through a Unary Minus block (`-`, V.6.0). This block inverts the sign of the input value.

5.  **Diagnostic Status Output:**
    *   The final, inverted value is output as `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN`, representing the calculated diagnostic status for the mechanical down position of the port flap actuator under the specific `RST` or `CLR` condition.


--- Page 58 ---

This image contains two related Simulink diagrams, Figure 2.5.36 and Figure 2.5.37, which together describe the management and update of diagnostic information for an automotive component named "PortMecUp," within the broader context of "AIRM Port flap actuator diagnosis."

## Function

The primary function of this system is to manage and update the diagnostic status of an automotive mechanism called "PortMecUp." Specifically, it defines an action to reset the diagnostic port and details the logic for how the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` diagnostic value is calculated and updated in response to a system reset (RST, e.g., a new driving cycle) or a failure memory clear (CLR) event.

## Inputs

The system takes the following key inputs:

*   **Trigger Signals:**
    *   `ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecUp_T3` (from Figure 2.5.36): A trigger signal that initiates the diagnostic reset action.
    *   `TriggerActionImport` (from Figure 2.5.37): An internal action trigger, likely derived from or linked to the primary trigger, that activates the detailed diagnostic update logic.
*   **`PRM_STATE_INI` (V.5.7):** A parameter representing the initial state configuration for the diagnostic process (Position: 1).
*   **`PRM_NR_CONF` (V.5.7):** A parameter representing the number of configurations relevant to the diagnostic process (Position: 2).
*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` (V.5.3):** The current diagnostic value or state of the "PortMecUp" mechanism. This input is crucial for feedback loops and for determining the updated state.

## Outputs

The main output of the system is:

*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` (V.5.3):** The updated diagnostic value or state for the "PortMecUp" mechanism, reflecting the outcome of the reset or clear operations.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow can be described by integrating the two diagrams:

1.  **Initiating the Diagnostic Reset Action (Figure 2.5.36):**
    *   The `ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecUp` subsystem is activated by an external trigger signal, `ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMecUp_T3`. This signifies a command to reset or update the diagnostic state.
    *   Upon activation, the subsystem's internal logic (`Trigger()` block) imports the current diagnostic context, including `PRM_STATE_INI`, `PRM_NR_CONF`, and the existing `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` value.
    *   The `Trigger()` block then processes these inputs to determine the new `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`. This internal processing is where the detailed logic from Figure 2.5.37 is assumed to reside or be invoked.
    *   The calculated `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` is then exported, completing the action. A "feedback" loop is explicitly shown, indicating that the exported value becomes the "current" `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` for subsequent executions or state management.

2.  **Detailed Diagnostic Update Logic (Figure 2.5.37 - assumed within the `Trigger()` block of Figure 2.5.36):**
    *   This subsystem is triggered by `TriggerActionImport` (likely tied to the overall action trigger) to perform the actual diagnostic value calculation.
    *   It receives `PRM_STATE_INI`, `PRM_NR_CONF`, and the current `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` as inputs.
    *   These inputs are fed into two parallel processing paths, representing different event handlers:
        *   **Reset (RST) Path (X.3.2.1.1):** This block calculates the diagnostic state if a "Reset" event (e.g., new driving cycle, system re-initialization) has occurred. It processes the input parameters and the current `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` to produce an updated state, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`. This typically involves setting diagnostic flags or counters to an initial state.
        *   **Clear (CLR) Path (X.3.2.1.2):** This block calculates the diagnostic state if a "Clear Failure Memory" event has occurred. It processes the same set of inputs to produce another updated state, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`. This path would typically clear any stored fault codes or error indicators associated with "PortMecUp."
    *   **Merging Outcomes:** The outputs (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`) from both the RST and CLR paths are directed to a `Merge` block. The `Merge` block's function is to select one of these two incoming signals as the final output. The selection logic (e.g., priority, which event occurred last, or concurrent operation) is implicit but crucial for correctly reflecting the system's state after a reset or clear operation.
    *   The chosen output from the `Merge` block then becomes the final `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` for the current cycle, which is then passed back to the higher-level action for export and potential feedback.

## Function
These Simulink diagrams (Figure 2.5.38, "RST", and Figure 2.5.39, "CLR") define the logical flow for determining the state of a diagnostic variable `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`, which is related to "Port flap actuator diagnosis" as indicated in the header. Their primary function is to implement conditional reset and clear functionalities for this diagnostic variable. They control when `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` is explicitly set to a default (reset or clear) state and when it's updated dynamically based on configuration parameters and feedback.

## Inputs
-   **PRM_STATE_INI:** (Input Port `1` in both diagrams) An initial state parameter that is checked to determine if a reset or clear operation should be performed.
-   **REST:** (Constant `+1.00000e+000` in RST diagram) A calibrated constant value that `PRM_STATE_INI` is compared against to trigger a reset.
-   **CLR:** (Constant `+0.00000e+000` in CLR diagram) A calibrated constant value that `PRM_STATE_INI` is compared against to trigger a clear.
-   **PRM_NR_CONF:** (Input Port `2` in both diagrams) A configuration parameter used by the `V.7.10` block to select between different data sources. This likely represents a confirmation status or a specific operational state.
-   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb:** (Input Port `3` in both diagrams) A feedback or current value of the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` diagnostic variable, representing its status from a previous cycle or sensor input.
-   **C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP:** A calibrated constant representing a default or reference value for the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` diagnostic variable.

## Outputs
-   **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP:** (Output Port `1` in both diagrams) The primary output, representing the updated state or value of the diagnostic variable for the port flap actuator.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow is structurally identical for both the "RST" and "CLR" diagrams, with the only difference being the specific constant value used for the initial state comparison.

1.  **Initial State Condition Check:**
    *   The input `PRM_STATE_INI` is compared against a specific constant value: `REST` for the "RST" diagram, or `CLR` for the "CLR" diagram.
    *   An equality block (`= V.6.2`) generates a boolean result (`V.6.2`). This result indicates whether the `PRM_STATE_INI` matches the condition for a reset or clear operation.

2.  **Conditional Output Selection (Reset/Clear or Normal Operation):**
    *   The block labeled `V.6.0`, which contains `cond_if` and a subtraction symbol (`-`), functions as a conditional output selector.
    *   **If `V.6.2` is TRUE** (i.e., `PRM_STATE_INI` matches `REST` or `CLR`): The `cond_if` logic within `V.6.0` activates a reset/clear path (indicated by the dashed line). In this scenario, the output `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` is directly set to a predefined reset or clear value (e.g., typically `0` for diagnostic flags, or an initial fault state). This effectively bypasses the detailed calculation path.
    *   **If `V.6.2` is FALSE** (i.e., `PRM_STATE_INI` does not match `REST` or `CLR`): The logic proceeds to calculate the diagnostic variable based on feedback and configuration parameters.

3.  **Diagnostic Value Calculation (Normal Operation Path):**
    *   A multiplexer or selector block (`V.7.10`) receives three inputs: `PRM_NR_CONF` (acting as a control input `c`), `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`, and `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`.
    *   Based on the value of `PRM_NR_CONF`, the `V.7.10` block selects one of the two data inputs: either the feedback value (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_fb`) or the calibrated constant (`C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP`). This selection forms the base for the diagnostic output when not in a reset/clear state.
    *   The selected value from `V.7.10` then passes through the remaining part of the `V.6.0` block, which includes a subtraction operation (`-`). This operation likely transforms the selected value. Depending on the implicit or explicit first input to the subtraction, this could be a negation (`0 - input`), a decrement from a predefined value, or another specific calculation relevant to the diagnostic state.

4.  **Final Output:**
    *   The ultimate value, determined by either the conditional reset/clear (step 2) or the diagnostic value calculation (step 3), is assigned to the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP` output.

This image presents two related Simulink-style diagrams, both pertaining to the diagnosis of a "Port flap actuator." The first diagram, "ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMednO," outlines a high-level action for resetting diagnostic information. The second diagram, "PortMecDownOver diagnosis information in case of failure memory clear (CLR) or new driving cycle (RST)," details the internal logic for managing diagnostic states under specific reset conditions.

## Function
The primary function of this system is to manage and reset diagnostic information for a "Port Mechanical Down Over" condition of a port flap actuator. It takes initial parameters and current diagnostic states, applies reset logic based on an explicit action, a new driving cycle (RST) event, or a failure memory clear (CLR) event, and then outputs the updated diagnostic status and memory values. Essentially, it ensures the diagnostic state is correctly initialized or updated based on various system events.

## Inputs
1.  **ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMednO_T3 (Global Trigger)**: A global signal that triggers the diagnostic reset action.
2.  **PRM_STATE_INI**: An initial state parameter, likely representing a default or starting state for the diagnostic monitoring. (Version: V.5.7)
3.  **PRM_NR_CONF**: A parameter for the number of confirmations, potentially related to debouncing or required occurrences of a fault before it's confirmed. (Version: V.5.7)
4.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER**: The current value of the diagnostic status for the "Port Mechanical Down Over" fault. (Version: V.5.3)
5.  **LV_V_PORT_MEM**: The current value stored in the "Port Memory," which likely holds historical or latched diagnostic data. (Version: V.5.3)
6.  **Feedback Signals (<T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER>, <LV_V_PORT_MEM>)**: These represent the previous cycle's output values, fed back into the system to maintain state or apply sequential logic.
7.  **Implicit Triggers (RST/CLR Events)**: While not explicit top-level inputs, the internal structure implies that events like a "new driving cycle" (RST) or "failure memory clear" (CLR) act as internal control inputs that determine which diagnostic logic path is executed.

## Outputs
1.  **ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMednO_T3 (ActionExport)**: An output signal confirming the action has been processed or triggering subsequent operations.
2.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER**: The updated diagnostic status for the "Port Mechanical Down Over" fault, reflecting the outcome of the reset/update logic. (Version: V.5.3)
3.  **LV_V_PORT_MEM**: The updated value for the "Port Memory," incorporating the results of the diagnostic processing. (Version: V.5.3)

## Logic Flow (Step-by-Step)
1.  **Action Trigger**: The process begins when the `ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMednO_T3` global signal activates the `ACTION_CREATOR` block. This trigger is then passed to an `ActionImport` block, signifying the start of the core diagnostic reset logic.
2.  **Input Acquisition**: The `ActionImport` block, labeled `X.3.3.1`, receives the necessary inputs: `PRM_STATE_INI`, `PRM_NR_CONF`, and the current diagnostic values `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` and `LV_V_PORT_MEM`. The latter two are also fed back from the system's previous outputs, indicating a stateful system where current outputs depend on past states.
3.  **Internal Diagnostic State Management (Subsystem X.3.3.1)**: The logic within `X.3.3.1` (detailed in Figure 2.5.41) processes these inputs based on specific conditions:
    *   **Subsystem Trigger**: An internal trigger (labeled `f()`) activates the logic within this subsystem.
    *   **Conditional Processing Paths**: The incoming diagnostic parameters (`PRM_STATE_INI`, `PRM_NR_CONF`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER_fb`, `LV_V_PORT_MEM_fb`) are routed to two distinct sub-processing branches:
        *   **RST Logic (X.3.3.1.1)**: This branch handles updates when a "new driving cycle" or a general reset (RST) event occurs. It calculates or updates `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` and `LV_V_PORT_MEM` according to the reset criteria for a new cycle.
        *   **CLR Logic (X.3.3.1.2)**: This branch handles updates when the "failure memory clear" (CLR) event occurs. It calculates or updates `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` and `LV_V_PORT_MEM` specifically for clearing the stored fault information.
    *   **Merge and Selection**: Two `Merge` blocks are used to select the appropriate output values. One `Merge` block selects between the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` outputs from the RST and CLR branches, while the other `Merge` block selects between the `LV_V_PORT_MEM` outputs. The selection mechanism (e.g., a control signal indicating which event, RST or CLR, has occurred) is implicit.
4.  **Output Generation**: The selected and updated `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` and `LV_V_PORT_MEM` values from the `Merge` blocks become the final outputs of the `ActionImport` block `X.3.3.1`.
5.  **Feedback and Export**: These final, updated diagnostic values are passed out of the main `ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMednO` block to other parts of the system and are simultaneously fed back as inputs for the next processing cycle. The initial `ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMednO_T3` signal is also exported, possibly to signal the completion of the diagnostic reset operation.


--- Page 61 ---

This image contains two Simulink-style diagrams, both related to "AIRM Port flap actuator diagnosis," specifically for handling reset (RST) and clear (CLR) conditions of diagnostic variables.

## Function

The primary function of these two subsystems is to manage and control the values of diagnostic and memory variables related to a port flap actuator's mechanical down overload condition. They determine whether to reset, clear, or maintain these variables based on the system's initialization/state (`PRM_STATE_INI`) and a configuration parameter (`PRM_NR_CONF`).

*   **2.5.3.3.1.1 RST (Reset) Subsystem:** This subsystem handles the initialization or resetting of the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` (a diagnostic timer/counter) and `LV_V_PORT_MEM` (a volatile memory variable) when the `PRM_STATE_INI` signals a reset state (represented by the value `+1.0000e+000`).
*   **2.5.3.3.1.2 CLR (Clear) Subsystem:** This subsystem handles the clearing of the `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` and `LV_V_PORT_MEM` variables when the `PRM_STATE_INI` signals a clear state (represented by the value `+0.0000e+000`).

## Inputs

Both diagrams share the same set of input signals:

*   **`PRM_STATE_INI`**: (Input Port 1) A parameter representing the current system state, specifically used to trigger a reset (value 1.0 in RST) or clear (value 0.0 in CLR) operation.
*   **`PRM_NR_CONF`**: (Input Port 2) A configuration parameter that acts as a control input for selecting between different data sources (e.g., feedback vs. constant/default).
*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER_fb`**: (Input Port 3) Feedback value for the mechanical down overload diagnostic timer/counter.
*   **`C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`**: A constant or threshold value used in the diagnostic logic for the mechanical down overload.
*   **`LV_V_PORT_MEM_fb`**: (Input Port 4) Feedback value for a volatile port memory variable, potentially a flag or a counter.

## Outputs

Both diagrams produce the same two output signals:

*   **`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`**: (Output Port 1) The calculated or reset/cleared value for the mechanical down overload diagnostic timer/counter.
*   **`LV_V_PORT_MEM`**: (Output Port 2) The calculated or reset/cleared value for the volatile port memory variable.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow for both the RST and CLR subsystems follows a similar conditional pattern:

1.  **State Comparison:**
    *   The `PRM_STATE_INI` signal is fed into a state-defining block: `REST` (V.6.5, value +1.0) for the RST diagram, or `CLR` (V.6.5, value +0.0) for the CLR diagram.
    *   An equality comparator (`=`, V.6.2) checks if `PRM_STATE_INI` matches the defined state from the `REST` or `CLR` block.
    *   The result of this comparison (true/false) drives an `If-Else` conditional block, indicated by `cond_if` (V.6.0). A dashed line indicates the "If" (true) path, and a solid line indicates the "Else" (false) path.

2.  **Conditional Execution (If `cond_if` is TRUE):**
    *   If the condition is true (i.e., `PRM_STATE_INI` matches the specified reset or clear state), the following actions are taken (dashed lines):
        *   **For `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`:** The output is set to a specific reset/clear value. The block labeled `V.6.0` (with a '-' symbol) represents this operation, typically setting the output to zero or a default initial value.
        *   **For `LV_V_PORT_MEM`:** The output is explicitly set to `0`, originating from the constant block `0` (V.6.4). This effectively clears the memory variable.

3.  **Conditional Execution (If `cond_if` is FALSE):**
    *   If the condition is false (i.e., `PRM_STATE_INI` does not match the specified reset or clear state), the system operates in a normal, non-reset/non-clear mode (solid lines):
        *   **For `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`:** A Multiport Switch/Selector block (V.7.10) determines the value. It selects between `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER_fb` (feedback) and `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER` (a constant/threshold) based on the control input `PRM_NR_CONF`. The selected value then becomes the output `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN_OVER`.
        *   **For `LV_V_PORT_MEM`:** Another Multiport Switch/Selector block (V.7.10) determines the value. It selects between `LV_V_PORT_MEM_fb` (feedback) and the constant `0` (V.6.4) based on the control input `PRM_NR_CONF`. The selected value then becomes the output `LV_V_PORT_MEM`.

In essence, these diagrams ensure that diagnostic and memory variables are appropriately initialized (RST) or reset to a clear state (CLR) under specific system conditions, while otherwise allowing them to be driven by feedback and configuration.

The provided image contains two distinct Simulink-like diagrams, both related to "AIRM Port flap actuator diagnosis" from Continental. I will analyze each diagram separately.

## Function

### Figure 2.5.44: ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeUpO
This diagram defines an action or function (`ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeUpO`) responsible for processing or resetting diagnostic data related to a "Port Mechanical Up Over" state. It takes current diagnostic parameters and system states as inputs, potentially processes them within a triggered subsystem, and then provides updated diagnostic outputs.

### Figure 2.5.45: PortMecUpOver diagnosis information in case of failure memory clear (CLR) or new driving cycle (RST)
This diagram details the logic for determining the final diagnostic values for "Port Mechanical Up Over" (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`) and "Port Memory" (`LV_V_PORT_MEM`) based on whether a "New Driving Cycle Reset" (RST) event or a "Failure Memory Clear" (CLC) event has occurred. It integrates results from two parallel processing paths (one for RST, one for CLC) to produce consolidated outputs.

---

---

## Logic Flow

### Figure 2.5.44: ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeUpO
1.  **Action Trigger:** The diagnostic action is initiated by the `ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeUpO` signal, received by an `ActionImport` block.
2.  **Parameter Input:** Key system parameters (`PRM_STATE_INI`, `PRM_NR_CONF`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`, `LV_V_PORT_MEM`) and feedback signals (`<T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_DOWN>`, `<LV_V_PORT_MEM>`) are supplied to the system.
3.  **Internal Processing:** All these inputs are routed into a central `Trigger()` subsystem (labeled X.3.4.1). This subsystem performs the core logic for resetting or preparing the diagnostic data. The specific internal operations are not visible in this diagram.
4.  **Output & Export:**
    *   Upon completion of the internal processing, an `ACTION_AIRM_ResetDiagPortMeUpO_T3` signal is exported, likely signaling the action's status.
    *   The `Trigger()` subsystem then outputs the processed/updated `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` and `LV_V_PORT_MEM` values, which are provided as the diagram's final diagnostic outputs.

### Figure 2.5.45: PortMecUpOver diagnosis information...
1.  **System Activation:** The diagram's logic is activated by a `Trigger` event (f()), which is fed into an `ActionImport` block. This block also receives current system parameters (`PRM_STATE_INI`, `PRM_NR_CONF`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`, `LV_V_PORT_MEM`).
2.  **Parallel Processing Paths:** The incoming parameters are fanned out to two independent, parallel subsystems:
    *   **RST Path (X.3.4.1.1):** This subsystem processes diagnostic information specifically for a "New Driving Cycle Reset" condition. It takes `PRM_STATE_INI`, `PRM_NR_CONF`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_fb`, and `LV_V_PORT_MEM_fb` as inputs.
    *   **CLC Path (X.3.4.1.2):** This subsystem processes diagnostic information specifically for a "Failure Memory Clear" condition. It also takes `PRM_STATE_INI`, `PRM_NR_CONF`, `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_fb`, and `LV_V_PORT_MEM_fb` as inputs.
3.  **Result Merging:**
    *   The output `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` from both the RST and CLC paths are directed to a `Merge` block. This block combines the two signals, typically by selecting one based on priority or condition, to produce the final `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` output.
    *   Similarly, the output `LV_V_PORT_MEM` from both the RST and CLC paths are directed to a second `Merge` block to produce the final `LV_V_PORT_MEM` output.
4.  **Consolidated Outputs:** The two `Merge` blocks provide the final, consolidated diagnostic values (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` and `LV_V_PORT_MEM`), reflecting the appropriate diagnostic state after considering either an RST or CLC event.


--- Page 63 ---

The provided image contains two distinct Simulink-style diagrams, labeled "2.5.3.4.1.1 RST" and "2.5.3.4.1.2 CLR". Both diagrams share a similar structure and purpose, differing primarily in the triggering condition for their operations.

## Function

The primary function of these diagrams is to manage the state of an automotive port flap actuator's diagnostic flag (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`) and an associated memory variable (`LV_V_PORT_MEM`). They implement conditional logic to either reset/clear these variables to default states or to update them based on feedback and other input conditions, as part of a port flap actuator diagnosis system.

## Inputs

Both diagrams utilize the following inputs:

1.  **PRM_STATE_INI (1, green):** Primary State Initialization. An input signal representing a system state. Its specific value (`1.0` for RST, `0.0` for CLR) triggers the reset/clear operation.
2.  **PRM_NR_CONF (2, green):** Primary Non-Confirmation. A signal (likely boolean or integer) representing a "non-confirmed" state, used as a default value for the diagnostic flag during a reset/clear.
3.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_fb (3, green):** Feedback for 'T Port Diagnostic Mechanical Up Overrun'. This is the current, previously stored value of the diagnostic flag, fed back into the system for continuous processing.
4.  **LV_V_PORT_MEM_fb (4, green):** Feedback for 'LV Port Memory'. This is the current, previously stored value of an associated memory variable, fed back for continuous processing.
5.  **C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER (implicit):** A constant or parameter, likely related to configurable diagnostic thresholds, used within the V.6.4 logic block for `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`.
6.  **Constant '0' (implicit):** A constant value used within the V.6.4 logic block for `LV_V_PORT_MEM`.

## Outputs

Both diagrams produce the following outputs:

1.  **T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER (1, blue):** The updated state of the 'T Port Diagnostic Mechanical Up Overrun' flag.
2.  **LV_V_PORT_MEM (2, blue):** The updated state of the 'LV Port Memory' variable.

## Logic Flow

The image presents two control logic diagrams, "2.5.3.4.1.1 RST" (Reset) and "2.5.3.4.1.2 CLR" (Clear), that control the update of `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` and `LV_V_PORT_MEM`. The logic flow is identical for both, except for the specific value of `PRM_STATE_INI` that triggers the conditional action.

1.  **Conditional Check (Equality Block V.6.2):**
    *   The `PRM_STATE_INI` input (1) is compared using an equality operator (`=`) against a specific constant.
        *   **For RST (Figure 2.5.46):** `PRM_STATE_INI` is compared to `REST` (which is `1.0`). If `PRM_STATE_INI == 1.0`, the condition `cond_if` becomes TRUE.
        *   **For CLR (Figure 2.5.47):** `PRM_STATE_INI` is compared to `CLR` (which is `0.0`). If `PRM_STATE_INI == 0.0`, the condition `cond_if` becomes TRUE.
    *   This `cond_if` signal (output from V.6.2 to V.6.0) acts as the control for a subsequent conditional switch.

2.  **Conditional Output Selection (Switch Block V.6.0):**
    The `cond_if` signal controls a switch-like block (V.6.0) for each output variable.

    *   **If `cond_if` is TRUE (Reset/Clear Condition):**
        *   The output `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` (1) is set directly to the value of `PRM_NR_CONF` (2). This implies that during a reset or clear, the diagnostic flag is forced to a "non-confirmed" state.
        *   The output `LV_V_PORT_MEM` (2) is set directly to the constant value `0`. This means the memory variable is cleared or reset to zero.

    *   **If `cond_if` is FALSE (Normal Operation):**
        *   **For `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER`:**
            *   The signals `PRM_NR_CONF` (2), `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_fb` (3), and an internal constant `C_T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` are fed into a logic block (V.6.4). This block calculates the *next* state of the diagnostic flag based on current feedback and conditions.
            *   The computed next state from V.6.4 is then passed to a memory element (V.7.10, typically a Unit Delay or Data Store Write block, where 'u' is the input value to store). This block stores the value, making it available as feedback (`T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER_fb`) in the subsequent time step.
            *   The stored value from V.7.10 is then output as `T_PORT_DIAG_MEC_UP_OVER` (1).

        *   **For `LV_V_PORT_MEM`:**
            *   The feedback value `LV_V_PORT_MEM_fb` (4) and an internal constant `0` are fed into another logic block (V.6.4). This block determines the *next* state of the memory variable based on its current value and the constant `0`.
            *   The computed next state from V.6.4 is then passed to a memory element (V.7.10). Similar to the diagnostic flag, this block stores the value, which becomes `LV_V_PORT_MEM_fb` for the next time step.
            *   The stored value from V.7.10 is then output as `LV_V_PORT_MEM` (2).

In summary, these diagrams provide robust conditional update mechanisms for critical diagnostic and memory variables, ensuring they can be explicitly reset/cleared under specific system states or updated through continuous operational logic.
