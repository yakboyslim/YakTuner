## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to **acquire, diagnose, model, and calculate various air and intake gas temperatures within an automotive engine system.** It processes raw sensor data, performs diagnostic checks for sensor validity and signal plausibility, and then uses these inputs to estimate and provide a set of refined temperatures at different critical points in the engine's air and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) paths. This information is vital for precise engine control strategies, such as fuel injection, ignition timing, and emissions management.

## Inputs

The key inputs to this system are:

1.  **`INC_NR_LTS_AIR`**: Raw air temperature sensor readings (e.g., from analog, PWM, CAN, SENT sensors).

10. **`NC_NR_TLTS_AIR_PLAU`**: Plausibility status for the air temperature sensor.
11. **`NC_NR_TIG_PLAU`**: Plausibility status for the intake gas temperature sensor.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow of the system can be described in five main steps:

**Step 1: Raw Temperature Acquisition and Initial Processing**
*   **Air Temperature:** The "Acquisition of air temperatures" block receives raw air temperature sensor signals (`INC_NR_LTS_AIR`) and their initial diagnostic flags (`TLTS_AIR_DIAG_MAES`). It processes these to output specific air temperature values relevant for different engine states, such as `TLTS_AIR_INTC` (for intercooler calculations) and `TLTS_AIR_CRNG_INTM` (for cranking conditions).
*   **Intake Gas Temperature:** Similarly, raw intake gas temperature signals (`INC_NR_TIG`) and their diagnostic status (`TIG_DIAG_MAES`) are acquired and passed to the "Temperature model" section for further processing and diagnostics.
*   **Ambient Air Temperature:** A raw measured ambient air temperature (`TAA_MES`) is also acquired and used as an input for the ambient temperature calculation.

**Step 2: Air Temperature Diagnostics (OBD I & OBD II)**
*   **OBD I (Sensor Electrical Diagnosis):** The "Signal diagnosis of ambient air temperature from INTC" (OBD I) block takes the processed air temperatures (`TLTS_AIR_INTC`, `TLTS_AIR_CRNG_INTM`) and an internal diagnostic state (`STATE_LTS_AIR_DIAG_PLAU`). It performs electrical and range checks (e.g., open circuit, short circuit, low/high range) on the air temperature sensor, outputting an error status (`STATE_LTS_AIR_DIAG_ERR`) and a sensor plausibility flag (`LV_STATE_LTS_AIR_PLAU`).
*   **OBD II (Sensor Plausibility):** The subsequent "Air temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis" (OBD II) block uses the air temperatures, the sensor plausibility flag (`LV_STATE_LTS_AIR_PLAU`), and diagnostic states to perform more advanced plausibility checks, ultimately outputting the final air temperature plausibility status (`NC_NR_TLTS_AIR_PLAU`).

**Step 3: Intake Gas Temperature Model and Diagnostics (OBD II)**
*   **Intake Gas Sensor Diagnostics/Modeling:** The "Air temperature sensor model" block (part of the "Temperature model") processes the acquired intake gas temperature (`TIG_MES`) and its diagnostic status. It uses various model parameters (`TEMP_HOT_SRC`, `TEMP_COLD_SRC`, `MMEV`) to generate preliminary intake gas temperatures (e.g., `TIG_IM`, `TIG_KO`, `TIG_NV`, `TIG_THR`) and an initial sensor plausibility flag (`LV_STATE_TIG_PLAU`).
*   **OBD II (Intake Gas Plausibility):** The "Intake gas temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis" (OBD II) block takes these preliminary temperatures and the sensor plausibility flag to conduct plausibility checks specific to the intake gas temperature sensor, outputting `NC_NR_TIG_PLAU`.

**Step 4: Ambient Temperature Calculation**
*   The "Ambient air temperature calculation" block receives the raw measured ambient air temperature (`TAA_MES`), an ambient air temperature model input (`TAA_M_MDL`), and its current state (`STATE_TAA`). It processes these inputs to compute a refined ambient air temperature (`TAA`) and updates the ambient air temperature state (`STATE_TAA`).

**Step 5: Detailed Intake Gas Temperature Modeling**
*   This section comprises several dedicated models for specific points in the intake and EGR system:
    *   **Intake gas temperature at intercooler:** Uses an upstream temperature (`TIG_KO_UP`) and a function `FC_INI_OPM_ART_MDL40_TIGKO` to calculate `TIG_KO`.
    *   **Intake gas temperature at intake manifold:** Takes an upstream temperature (`TIG_IM_UP`) and various model parameters/states (`STATE_HEAT_IM`, `STATE_COOL_IM`, `MMEV`, `TIG_M_MDL_IM`) with function `FC_INI_OPM_ART_MDL40_TIGIM` to calculate `TIG_IM`.
    *   **Intake gas temperature at intake valve:** Similar to the manifold model, it uses `TIG_NV_UP`, specific states/parameters, and function `FC_INI_OPM_ART_MDL40_TIGNV` to calculate `TIG_NV`.
    *   **Intake gas temperature at throttle:** Uses `TIG_THR_UP`, specific states/parameters, and function `FC_INI_OPM_ART_MDL40_TIGTHR` to calculate `TIG_THR`.
    *   **Intake gas temperature for exhaust gas recirculation:** This model uses `TIG_EGR_H_UP` as an input and an EGR-specific model input (`TIG_M_MDL_EGR_H`) with function `FC_INI_OPM_ART_MDL40_TIGEGR` to calculate both downstream (`TIG_EGR_H_DOWN`) and upstream (`TIG_EGR_H_UP`) EGR temperatures, likely representing an iterative or state-based calculation within the block.

The validated and calculated temperatures, along with the diagnostic statuses, are then made available as outputs for other automotive control modules.

This image displays a Simulink (or similar block diagram environment like TargetLink/ASCET) model for an automotive system.

## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram, titled "AIRT. Air temperature sensor model", is to manage the activation, initialization, and operational logic for one or more air temperature sensor models (specifically "TLTS_MDL_1" and "TLTS_MDL_2"). It handles the system's state transitions, validation of sensor data, and calculation of output values based on various input parameters and internal logic, operating on a discrete-time basis (likely 1-second recurrence for the operational part). The diagram also specifies how variables are initialized during reset and ignition-on (IGKON) events.

## Inputs

The key inputs to this system are:

*   **`LV_IGK`**: Ignition key status or a main activation signal.
*   **`FLOW_EGR_AIRT`**: Airflow rate related to EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) and air temperature.
*   **`LV_TLTS_MDL_1_INP_VLD`**: Input validation flag for Temperature/Level/Time Sensor Model 1.
*   **`LV_TLTS_MDL_2_INP_VLD`**: Input validation flag for Temperature/Level/Time Sensor Model 2.
*   **`M_GAS_TLTS_MDL_AIRT`**: Mass of gas relevant for the TLTS air temperature model.
*   **`N`**: Engine speed.
*   **`NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF`**: Configuration parameter for the TLTS models (e.g., enable/disable, type selection).
*   **`PO_AIRT`**: Air temperature pressure (pre-conditioning or raw sensor pressure).
*   **`RATE_HEAT_IMS`**: Heat rate for an internal measurement system.
*   **`TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV`**: Mean measured value of a cold temperature source.
*   **`TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV`**: Mean measured value of a hot temperature source.
*   **`TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_1`**: Input for initializing or processing TLTS Model 1 (e.g., target temperature).
*   **`TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_2`**: Input for initializing or processing TLTS Model 2.
*   **`ZVS`**: An unspecified system parameter, possibly a zero-voltage switch or similar state.

## Outputs

The key outputs from this system are:

*   **`LV_TLTS_MDL_1_VLD`**: Output validation flag for TLTS Model 1.
*   **`LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD`**: Output validation flag for TLTS Model 2.
*   **`STATE_TLTS_MDL_1`**: Current operational state of TLTS Model 1.
*   **`STATE_TLTS_MDL_2`**: Current operational state of TLTS Model 2.
*   **`TLTS_MDL_1`**: The primary calculated output value for TLTS Model 1 (e.g., air temperature).
*   **`TLTS_MDL_2`**: The primary calculated output value for TLTS Model 2.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow of the diagram can be broken down into three main blocks:

1.  **APP_CDN V.7.2 (Application Control/Deactivation/Activation):**
    *   This block acts as the master controller for the entire model. Its primary input is `LV_IGK`, which dictates the system's activation status.
    *   It defines a "Recurrence" of "1S" (1 second), indicating the operational model is likely executed at this rate.
    *   It handles "Init: RST IGKON" (Initialization at Reset and Ignition On) and "Activation: LV_IGK".
    *   It also contains "Deactivation: if activation not true" logic.
    *   It outputs `fc_INI` (likely a control signal for initialization) to the `INI X.1` block and `fc_OPM_1S` (control signal for operational model, 1-second recurrence) to both `INI X.1` and `OPM X.2` blocks.

2.  **INI X.1 (Initialization Block):**
    *   Triggered by the `fc_INI` signal from `APP_CDN`.
    *   It receives a wide array of inputs (most of the green input blocks, like `FLOW_EGR_AIRT`, `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF`, `TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_1/2`, etc.) which are necessary for setting up initial conditions.
    *   As per the accompanying text, this block is responsible for initializing variables at reset and IGKON. Specifically, `TLTS_MDL_1/2` are initialized using `TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL1/2`, and other variables are typically set to zero, except for trailing pointers.
    *   It passes these initialized values or states via its `ini` output port to the `OPM X.2` block.

3.  **OPM X.2 (Operational Model Block):**
    *   This is the core operational block, continuously executing its logic, likely at the 1-second recurrence rate dictated by `fc_OPM_1S` from `APP_CDN`.
    *   It receives the `ini` signals (initialized values/states) from `INI X.1`.
    *   It takes all the real-time sensor and system inputs (the same set of green input blocks as `INI X.1`).
    *   It also features a `feedback` loop, indicating that its previous output states or calculated values are fed back as inputs for the current calculation cycle (common for stateful systems or integrators).
    *   Inside `OPM X.2`, the actual processing for the air temperature sensor models takes place. This likely involves:
        *   Processing sensor inputs,
        *   Applying configuration based on `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF`,
        *   Evaluating validation criteria for `TLTS_MDL_1` and `TLTS_MDL_2`,
        *   Calculating the current `STATE_TLTS_MDL_1` and `STATE_TLTS_MDL_2`,
        *   Performing the actual temperature/level/time calculations to produce `TLTS_MDL_1` and `TLTS_MDL_2`.
    *   The extensive list of intermediate signals produced by `OPM X.2` before reaching the final outputs (e.g., `CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2`, `TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2`, `T_TLTS_MDL_1`, etc.) suggests a complex internal logic possibly involving stabilization algorithms, threshold checks, and averaging.

In summary, the `APP_CDN` orchestrates the overall lifecycle, `INI X.1` prepares the system for operation, and `OPM X.2` performs the ongoing sensor modeling, validation, and output calculations based on current inputs, initial conditions, and past states.

This image is indeed a Simulink diagram.

## Function
This Simulink diagram outlines an architecture for an air temperature sensor model, specifically managing the selection and operation of different air temperature models based on a configuration parameter. Its primary function is to compute an operational air temperature (`opm`) by selecting and executing one or more underlying air temperature models (`CLC_TLTS_MDL_1`, `CLC_TLTS_MDL_2`) based on a configuration setting and processing raw input and feedback signals.

## Inputs
1.  **input (green block 1):** Primary input signal, likely the raw air temperature sensor reading or a similar physical measurement.
2.  **feedback (green block 2):** A feedback signal, which could be from a control loop or an adjusted value.
3.  **NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF (signal):** A numerical configuration parameter that determines which air temperature model or operational mode should be active. It is compared against values 1, 2, and 3.
4.  **CONF (block):** A signal derived from or directly related to `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF`, indicating configuration.
5.  **C_TLTS_MDL_CLC_SRC (block):** An input or parameter used in one of the configuration selection branches, potentially a source for a specific calculation or a boolean flag.
6.  **Constant blocks (0, 1):** Used within the configuration logic for comparisons or as default values.

## Outputs
1.  **opm (blue block 1):** The final merged output of the selected air temperature model, representing the operational air temperature. It is a bus signal, indicating it may contain multiple related temperature values or status information.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow can be broken down into two main parts: configuration selection and model execution.

### 1. Configuration Selection (Top Section)
*   The `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF` signal, which dictates the system's operational mode or chosen model, is fed into a series of conditional (If-Else) blocks.
*   **If `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF == 3`:**
    *   The `C_TLTS_MDL_CLC_SRC` signal is compared to `0` using an equality block (`=`, V.6.2).
    *   The boolean result of this comparison then drives an `if` block (`cond_if`, V.6.3).
    *   If `C_TLTS_MDL_CLC_SRC == 0` (condition true), a signal labeled '1' is produced.
    *   Otherwise (condition false), a signal labeled '2' is produced.
*   **If `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF == 2`:**
    *   A constant `1` is compared to `0` using an equality block (`=`, V.6.2). This comparison `1 == 0` is always false.
    *   The false result then drives another `if` block (`cond_if`, V.6.3).
    *   Since the condition is always false, the 'else' branch is taken, producing a signal labeled '2'. (This implies that when `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF` is 2, a specific output '2' is always generated from this branch).
*   **If `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF == 1`:**
    *   This condition activates a third branch. The explicit output value isn't labeled, but it feeds into the subsequent Merge block.
*   **Configuration Signal Merging:** The outputs from these conditional branches (the signals labeled '1', '2', and the unnamed output from the `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF == 1` path) are combined into a single output by a 'Merge' block. This merged signal, along with the original `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF` and `CONF` signals, then serves as a control input for the main air temperature models.

### 2. Model Execution and Output (Bottom Section)
*   **Model Inputs:** The `input` and `feedback` signals are routed to two primary air temperature model subsystems: `CLC_TLTS_MDL_1` (X.2.1) and `CLC_TLTS_MDL_2` (X.2.2).
*   **Model Control:** The configuration signals (`NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF`, `CONF`, and the merged configuration signal from the top section) are also fed into these model subsystems. The triangular symbols on the inputs of the `f()` blocks (likely function call or enabled subsystems) wrapping the core models suggest that the configuration signals either enable, trigger, or parameterize these models. The thick blue line around `CLC_TLTS_MDL_2` might indicate its active state or specific highlighting.
*   **Parallel Processing / Selection:** It's inferred that based on the `NC_TLTS_MDL_CONF` and derived configuration, either one specific model (e.g., `CLC_TLTS_MDL_1` or `CLC_TLTS_MDL_2`) is primarily active, or they operate in conjunction, with their internal logic adjusted by the configuration.
*   **Output Aggregation:** The individual outputs from `CLC_TLTS_MDL_1` and `CLC_TLTS_MDL_2` are then combined using a `BusMerge` block (V.6.0). This block consolidates multiple signals (likely of different types or structures) into a single output bus.
*   **Final System Output:** The resultant bus from the `BusMerge` block forms the final output of the entire system, labeled `opm`, which represents the processed operational air temperature.

## Function

This Simulink diagram, titled "3.7.2.1 Overview of air temperature model 1," represents a control logic for an air temperature sensor model (AIRT). Its primary function is to process sensor input, manage different operational states of the temperature model, and output a validated and conditioned air temperature value along with its status. The model conditionally activates different sub-models (conditioning, active temperature calculation, or deactivation) based on input validity and the current operational state.

## Inputs

The following key signals are identified as inputs to this top-level model:

*   **`input`** (Boolean/Numeric, Port 1): A primary input signal, immediately interpreted as `LV_TLTS_MDL_1_INP_VLD` (Input Validity for Temperature Limiting Temperature Sensor Model 1).
*   **`feedback`** (Generic, Port 2): A generic feedback input, though its direct use in the visible logic is not explicit; it is connected to the input multiplexer.
*   **`<STATE_TLTS_MDL_1>`** (Integer/Enum): The current operational state of the temperature model 1. This is a feedback input, representing the state from the previous iteration or an initial state.
*   **`<T_TLTS_MDL_1>`** (Numeric): The current calculated or estimated air temperature from model 1. This is also a feedback input.
*   **`<VS>`** (Numeric): Vehicle Speed or a similar vehicle status signal, used for conditioning and calculation.
*   **`<TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_1>`** (Generic): A trigger or specific input signal relevant for the temperature model's calculation.
*   **`<TLTS_MDL_1>`** (Numeric): An input representing a temperature value, possibly a raw sensor reading or a less processed temperature.
*   **`<LV_TLTS_MDL_1_VLD>`** (Boolean): The validity status associated with the input `TLTS_MDL_1` signal.

## Outputs

The model outputs a single bus signal:

*   **`clc_mdl_1`** (Bus, Port 1): A bus that bundles the following processed signals:
    *   **`<STATE_TLTS_MDL_1>`** (Integer/Enum): The updated operational state of the temperature model.
    *   **`<TLTS_MDL_1>`** (Numeric): The processed, estimated, or output temperature value from the active sub-model.
    *   **`<T_TLTS_MDL_1>`** (Numeric): A refined or stabilized temperature value from the active sub-model.
    *   **`<LV_TLTS_MDL_1_VLD>`** (Boolean): The validity status of the overall `clc_mdl_1` output.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow of the diagram is primarily governed by conditional execution based on input validity and the current model state:

1.  **Input Validity Evaluation**:
    *   The `input` signal is interpreted as `LV_TLTS_MDL_1_INP_VLD`.
    *   An "If" block (V.6.0 labeled `cond_if`) checks the status of `LV_TLTS_MDL_1_INP_VLD`.
        *   **If `LV_TLTS_MDL_1_INP_VLD` is True (Input Valid)**: The 'if' branch is executed. It passes the current `<STATE_TLTS_MDL_1>` directly to the next stage of the logic.
        *   **If `LV_TLTS_MDL_1_INP_VLD` is False (Input Invalid)**: The 'else' branch is executed. It passes a constant `1` (potentially signifying a default or error state) and the original `<STATE_TLTS_MDL_1>` to the next stage. The precise selection mechanism here is somewhat abstract but implies either selecting `1` or `STATE_TLTS_MDL_1` as the effective state for the next step.

2.  **State-Dependent Sub-Model Selection**:
    *   The output from the first "If" block (which represents the relevant state or a default) is compared to a constant `1` using an equality comparison block (V.6.4). This comparison result (boolean) controls a second "If" block (V.6.0 labeled `cond_if`). This comparison likely determines if the model is in an "active" or "deactivated" state.
    *   **If the derived state is `1` (Active State)**: The 'if' branch of this second "If" block is executed, activating the primary operational path:
        *   The `CLC_CDN` (Conditioning) subsystem is activated. It takes `<T_TLTS_MDL_1>` and `<VS>` as inputs and outputs an updated `<STATE_TLTS_MDL_1>`.
        *   The `CLC_TLTS_MDL_1` (Temperature Model 1) subsystem is activated. It processes `<VS>`, `<TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_1>`, `<TLTS_MDL_1>`, `<T_TLTS_MDL_1>`, and `<LV_TLTS_MDL_1_VLD>`. It calculates and outputs its own set of `<STATE_TLTS_MDL_1>`, `<TLTS_MDL_1>`, `<T_TLTS_MDL_1>`, and `<LV_TLTS_MDL_1_VLD>`.
    *   **If the derived state is NOT `1` (Deactivated State)**: The 'else' branch of this second "If" block is executed, activating the deactivation path:
        *   The `CLC_TLTS_MDL_1_DEAC` (Deactivation) subsystem is activated. It takes `<TLTS_MDL_1>` as input and outputs its own set of `<STATE_TLTS_MDL_1>`, `<TLTS_MDL_1>`, `<T_TLTS_MDL_1>`, and `<LV_TLTS_MDL_1_VLD>`.

3.  **Output Aggregation**:
    *   The outputs from the currently active sub-model (either `CLC_TLTS_MDL_1` or `CLC_TLTS_MDL_1_DEAC`, with the `STATE_TLTS_MDL_1` potentially overridden or conditioned by `CLC_CDN` if active) are directed to a `BusMerge` block (V.6.4).
    *   The `BusMerge` combines these individual signals (`STATE_TLTS_MDL_1`, `TLTS_MDL_1`, `T_TLTS_MDL_1`, `LV_TLTS_MDL_1_VLD`) into a single output bus, `clc_mdl_1`.

*Self-correction note: The second diagram, "3.7.2.1.1 Calculation of stability," likely details the internal logic of one of the subsystems, specifically `CLC_TLTS_MDL_1` or `CLC_CDN`, showing how temperature and state stability are calculated based on limits and vehicle speed.*

This image displays a Simulink (or a similar block-diagram environment like TargetLink, given the specific block naming conventions and versioning) model representing an "Overview of air temperature model 2."

## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to calculate, condition, and manage the state and outputs of an air temperature sensor model (AIRT). It integrates various physical inputs and internal states, applies conditional logic for input validation, operational mode selection, and potentially deactivation, to produce a comprehensive set of air temperature-related data. It appears to be a hierarchical model designed for robust operation within an automotive system, handling different operational states and ensuring output validity.

## Inputs

The model receives the following key inputs:

*   **`input`**: A generic input signal to the model, likely representing a primary temperature reading or estimation.
*   **`feedback`**: A generic feedback signal, potentially for closed-loop control or state tracking.
*   **`LV_TLTS_MDL_2_INP_VLD`**: Boolean flag indicating the validity of the main `input` signal for Temperature Limit Thresholds Model 2.
*   **`STATE_TLTS_MDL_2`**: The current state of the Temperature Limit Thresholds Model 2, used for internal logic and comparison.
*   **`TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV`**: Measured or estimated temperature from a cold source.
*   **`TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV`**: Measured or estimated temperature from a hot source.
*   **`M_GAS_TLTS_MDL_AIRT`**: Mass flow rate of gas relevant to the air temperature model.
*   **`n`**: Engine speed or a similar rotational speed input.
*   **`VS`**: Vehicle speed or a similar speed input.
*   **`FLOW_EGR_AIRT`**: Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) flow relevant to air temperature.
*   **`RATE_HEAT_IM`**: Rate of heat input or exchange.
*   **`TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_2`**: Input temperature specific for the TLTS Model 2.
*   **`TLTS_MDL_2`**: A signal representing the Temperature Limit Thresholds Model 2, potentially an internal or previous output value.
*   **`LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD`**: A validation status for the TLTS Model 2, potentially an input indicating prior validity.

## Outputs

The model produces a single output bus named `clc_mdl_2`, which contains the following individual signals:

*   **`STATE_TLTS_MDL_2`**: The updated or calculated state of the Temperature Limit Thresholds Model 2.
*   **`LV_CDN_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2`**: Validation or status related to vehicle stability conditioning for the TLTS Model 2.
*   **`T_TLTS_MDL_2`**: The primary calculated temperature output from the TLTS Model 2.
*   **`LV_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2`**: Validation or status related to vehicle stability for the TLTS Model 2.
*   **`FAC_TLTS_MDL_2`**: A calculated factor for the TLTS Model 2.
*   **`TIG_OFS_TLTS_MDL_2`**: A calculated offset for the TLTS Model 2.
*   **`TLTS_MDL_2_ACT`**: Boolean flag indicating the active status of the TLTS Model 2.
*   **`LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD`**: The output validation status for the TLTS Model 2.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow of the diagram can be described step-by-step:

1.  **Input Conditioning (Top Branch):**
    *   The generic `input` signal is first processed through a conditional block (`cond_if`). This block uses the `LV_TLTS_MDL_2_INP_VLD` signal as a condition (`V.6.0`). If `LV_TLTS_MDL_2_INP_VLD` is true, the `input` signal is passed; otherwise, an alternative "else" path (likely a default or safe value) is selected.
    *   The output of this first conditional block, along with the `feedback` signal, is directed towards the `CLC_CDN` subsystem.

2.  **State-Dependent Path Selection (Middle Branch):**
    *   The `STATE_TLTS_MDL_2` input is compared for equality with `1` (`V.6.4` block performs `STATE_TLTS_MDL_2 == 1`). The boolean result of this comparison (`V.6.2`) feeds into a second conditional block (`cond_if`).
    *   This second `cond_if` block, similar to the first, selects between its "if" and "else" paths, determining how control signals or data paths are routed to the subsequent subsystems, particularly influencing `CLC_CDN`.

3.  **Core Subsystem Execution:**
    *   **`CLC_CDN` (Conditioning) (X.2.2.1):** This subsystem receives the conditioned `input` and `feedback` signals. It is responsible for conditioning these inputs and deriving preliminary model outputs such as `STATE_TLTS_MDL_2` (conditioned state), `LV_CDN_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2` (vehicle stability conditioning), `T_TLTS_MDL_2` (conditioned temperature), and `LV_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2` (vehicle stability status). These outputs are passed to the `BusMerge` block.
    *   **`CLC_TLTS_MDL_2` (Temperature Limit Thresholds Model 2) (X.2.2.2):** This is the main air temperature calculation block. It receives a comprehensive set of physical inputs (`TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV`, `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV`, `M_GAS_TLTS_MDL_AIRT`, `n`, `VS`, `FLOW_EGR_AIRT`, `RATE_HEAT_IM`, `TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_2`, `TLTS_MDL_2`, `LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD`). It computes the core model outputs including `FAC_TLTS_MDL_2` (factor), `TIG_OFS_TLTS_MDL_2` (offset), `STATE_TLTS_MDL_2` (model state), `T_TLTS_MDL_2` (calculated temperature), `TLTS_MDL_2_ACT` (activation status), and `LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD` (validation status). Its activation or contribution to the final output is likely controlled by the conditional logic from the `cond_if` blocks via the `fc()` signal paths.
    *   **`CLC_TLTS_MDL_2_DEAC` (Deactivation) (X.2.2.3):** This subsystem receives the `TLTS_MDL_2` signal and presumably handles the deactivation logic for the model, ensuring graceful shutdown or default values when the model is not active. Its output is also fed to the `BusMerge`.

4.  **Output Bus Merging:**
    *   All the derived outputs from `CLC_CDN`, `CLC_TLTS_MDL_2`, and `CLC_TLTS_MDL_2_DEAC` are collected and combined into a single output bus named `clc_mdl_2` by the `BusMerge` block (`V.6.4`).
    *   The presence of the same signal names (e.g., `STATE_TLTS_MDL_2`, `T_TLTS_MDL_2`) originating from different sub-models implies that the `fc()` (function-call enabled or conditional subsystem) blocks, controlled by the `cond_if` blocks, select which source's output is active and ultimately merged into the bus. This ensures only one valid signal for each element is passed to the final output bus based on the model's operational state.

This image is indeed a Simulink diagram representing a model for an automotive system, likely related to an Air Temperature Sensor (AIRT) and its stability. The diagram outlines calculations for stability, specifically "Overview of calculation for stability".

## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to **calculate and determine various stability parameters and states for an air temperature sensor model**, incorporating both vehicle-related and temperature-related stability checks. It processes numerous physical and feedback signals to derive multiple stability outputs, including calculated stability levels, a global stability status, and a final stability state. It also features a conditional logic to select between a newly computed vehicle stability value and a prior/default one based on derived temperature stability conditions.

## Inputs

The system receives a comprehensive set of inputs, categorized as primary measurements/parameters and feedback signals:

*   **Primary Inputs (from 'input' port):**
    *   `<VS>`: Supply Voltage (likely).
    *   `<N>`: Engine Speed or similar rotational speed.
    *   `<PQ_AIRT>`: Air pressure/quantity at AIRT (Air Temperature Sensor).
    *   `<FLOW_EGR_AIRT>`: EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) flow at AIRT.
    *   `<M_GAS_TLTS_MDL_AIRT>`: Gas mass (or mass flow) for the AIRT model.
    *   `<TEMP_HOT_SRC>`: Temperature of a hot source affecting the sensor.
    *   `<RATE_HEAT_IM>`: Rate of heat input or change in heat.

*   **Feedback Inputs (from 'feedback' port):** These represent outputs from previous iterations or states of the system.
    *   `<T_TLTS_MDL_2>`: Sensor temperature or temperature derived from the model.
    *   `<TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_2>`: Trigger Input for the sensor model.
    *   `<TIG_STAB_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2>`: Maximum trigger stability threshold for the sensor model.
    *   `<TIG_STAB_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2>`: Minimum trigger stability threshold for the sensor model.
    *   `<CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`: Counter or control signal for trigger stability.
    *   `<STATE_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`: Current state of trigger stability for the sensor model.

## Outputs

The diagram produces several key outputs indicating various aspects of stability:

*   `<LV_CDN_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`: Calculated vehicle stability level for the sensor model (direct output from the vehicle stability block).
*   `<T_TLTS_MDL_2>`: Calculated sensor temperature or model-derived temperature (direct output from the vehicle stability block).
*   `<LV_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`: Conditional vehicle stability level output, which is either the newly calculated value or a passed-through previous value.
*   `clc_stab`: A computed overall stability status or flag, derived from the temperature stability checks.
*   `<STATE_TLTS_MDL_2>`: The final stability state for the sensor model, determined by the temperature stability logic.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow of the diagram can be broken down into two main processing paths, one for "Vehicle Stability" and one for "Temperature/Trigger Stability", with interactions between them:

1.  **Vehicle Stability Calculation Path (Top Subsystem - CLC_CDN_VEH_STAB):**
    *   A large set of inputs, including primary measurements (like VS, N, temperatures, flows) and several feedback signals (including T_TLTS_MDL_2, and various TIG_STAB signals), are multiplexed and fed into the `CLC_CDN_VEH_STAB` subsystem (X.2.2.1.1).
    *   This subsystem directly calculates and outputs two main signals:
        *   `<LV_CDN_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`: A stability level related to vehicle conditions.
        *   `<T_TLTS_MDL_2>`: The model's calculated sensor temperature.
    *   A second instance of `<LV_CDN_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>` from the `CLC_CDN_VEH_STAB` block is fed into a Switch block (V.6.1). The other input to this switch is a direct pass-through of `<LV_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>` from the input multiplexer (likely a previous or default value).
    *   The selection of which signal to output as `<LV_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>` is controlled by the `clc_taa_stab` signal, which is generated in the Temperature Stability path. If `clc_taa_stab` is true (or 1), the newly calculated `<LV_CDN_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>` is selected; otherwise, the previous/default `<LV_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>` is selected.

2.  **Temperature/Trigger Stability Calculation Path (Bottom Subsystem - CLC_CDN_TEMP_STAB):**
    *   The `CLC_CDN_TEMP_STAB` subsystem (X.2.2.1.2) receives a `<feedback>` signal, which is a portion of the multiplexed feedback inputs, specifically related to trigger stability (TIG_INP, TIG_MAX, TIG_MIN, CTR_TIG).
    *   The output of `CLC_CDN_TEMP_STAB` is then compared to a constant value of `1` using an 'Equals' block (V.6.5).
    *   In parallel, the feedback signal `<STATE_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>` is also compared to `1` using another 'Equals' block (V.6.5).
    *   Both comparison results are fed into an 'AND' gate (V.6.9). This means that both conditions must be true (i.e., output of `CLC_CDN_TEMP_STAB` is 1 AND `<STATE_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>` is 1) for the AND gate to output true.
    *   The output of the AND gate controls a Switch block (V.6.4). If the AND condition is true, it passes a `1`; otherwise, it passes a `0`.
    *   This result then goes into a "Check != 0" block (V.6.6), which effectively outputs true (1) if the input is non-zero, and false (0) if the input is zero.
    *   The output of the "Check != 0" block is assigned to `clc_taa_stab`. This signal serves two purposes:
        *   It controls the Switch block in the Vehicle Stability Path, determining whether the new or previous vehicle stability value is used.
        *   It is passed through a Gain block (V.6.1) to produce the `clc_stab` output, representing an overall stability status.
        *   It directly constitutes the final `<STATE_TLTS_MDL_2>` output, which is the overall stability state of the sensor model.

In essence, the system continuously calculates vehicle and temperature-related stability parameters. The temperature/trigger stability logic plays a crucial role by providing a gating mechanism (`clc_taa_stab`) that influences how the vehicle stability output is ultimately presented and also directly determines the overall stability status and state of the sensor model.

This image displays a Simulink diagram, not a text page or a table.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to determine the stability status of an air temperature sensor signal within a vehicle system. It evaluates two main conditions:
1.  **Operating Condition Suitability**: It checks if various vehicle operating parameters (like speed, engine speed, different temperature and flow rates) are within predefined stable ranges. This forms a prerequisite for a valid temperature stability assessment.
2.  **Air Temperature Stability**: It dynamically tracks and adjusts an air temperature value based on the operating conditions, and then compares this tracked value against a maximum threshold to determine if the air temperature signal itself is stable.

The diagram aims to output signals indicating whether the conditions for stability checks are met and whether the air temperature signal is stable, likely contributing to a diagnostic state or control logic (e.g., `STATE_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2` mentioned in the accompanying text).

## Inputs
The inputs to this system include various vehicle parameters and configuration constants:

*   **<VS>**: Vehicle Speed.
*   **C_VS_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2**: Maximum threshold for Vehicle Speed.
*   **C_VS_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2**: Minimum threshold for Vehicle Speed.
*   **<nN>**: Engine Speed.
*   **C_N_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2**: Minimum threshold for Engine Speed.
*   **<PO_AIRT>**: Air Pressure related to the Air Temperature sensor.
*   **C_PO_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2**: Maximum threshold for Air Pressure.
*   **C_PO_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2**: Minimum threshold for Air Pressure.
*   **<FLOW_EGR_AIRT>**: EGR Air Flow.
*   **C_FLOW_EGR_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2**: Maximum threshold for EGR Air Flow.
*   **C_FLOW_EGR_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2**: Minimum threshold for EGR Air Flow.
*   **<M_GAS_TLTS_MDL_AIRT>**: Mass Gas Flow related to air temperature.
*   **C_M_GAS_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2**: Maximum threshold for Mass Gas Flow.
*   **C_M_GAS_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2**: Minimum threshold for Mass Gas Flow.
*   **<TEMP_HOT_SRC>**: Temperature from a Hot Source.
*   **C_TEMP_HOT_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2**: Maximum threshold for Hot Source Temperature.
*   **C_TEMP_HOT_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2**: Minimum threshold for Hot Source Temperature.
*   **<RATE_HEAT_IM>**: Rate of Heat Input/Change.
*   **C_RATE_HEAT_IM_TLTS_MDL_2**: Maximum threshold for Rate of Heat Input.
*   **<T_TLTS_MDL_2>**: The current Air Temperature signal being evaluated for stability.
*   **C_T_TLTS_MDL_2_INC**: Increment value for the tracked air temperature.
*   **C_T_TLTS_MDL_2_DEC**: Decrement value for the tracked air temperature.
*   **Check == 0**: A boolean condition (likely a flag) that, when true, resets or uses the raw air temperature.
*   **C_T_TLTS_MDL_2_MAX**: Maximum allowed threshold for the tracked air temperature to be considered stable.

## Outputs
The diagram produces three key outputs:

*   **<LV_CON_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>**: A boolean signal (True/False) indicating if the overall vehicle operating conditions are suitable for assessing the temperature sensor's stability.
*   **<T_TLTS_MDL_2>**: A processed and tracked air temperature value, likely a state variable that is updated in each cycle for ongoing stability assessment.
*   **<LV_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>**: A boolean signal (True/False) indicating if the tracked air temperature has exceeded its maximum stability threshold, suggesting an unstable air temperature condition.

## Logic Flow
The logic flows in two main parallel streams that converge: one to determine if conditions are suitable for stability evaluation, and another to actually evaluate the temperature's stability.

1.  **Evaluation of Operating Conditions (Left Side)**:
    *   Multiple input parameters (<VS>, <nN>, <PO_AIRT>, <FLOW_EGR_AIRT>, <M_GAS_TLTS_MDL_AIRT>, <TEMP_HOT_SRC>, <RATE_HEAT_IM>) are compared against their respective minimum and/or maximum constant thresholds (e.g., C_VS_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2, C_VS_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2).
    *   For most parameters (VS, PO_AIRT, FLOW_EGR_AIRT, M_GAS_TLTS_MDL_AIRT, TEMP_HOT_SRC), the parameter must be simultaneously greater than or equal to its minimum AND less than its maximum. These produce individual boolean results.
    *   For <nN>, it must be greater than or equal to C_N_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2.
    *   For <RATE_HEAT_IM>, it must be less than C_RATE_HEAT_IM_TLTS_MDL_2.
    *   All these individual boolean comparison results are fed into a large `AND` gate (V.6.6).
    *   The output of this large `AND` gate is **<LV_CON_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>**. This signal is TRUE only if *all* defined operating conditions are met, indicating that the vehicle is in a state where temperature stability can be reliably assessed.

2.  **Dynamic Air Temperature Tracking and Stability Assessment (Right Side)**:
    *   The current air temperature signal, **<T_TLTS_MDL_2>** (input to this section), is used as a base.
    *   This base temperature is routed to two summing blocks: one adds **C_T_TLTS_MDL_2_INC** (increment) and the other subtracts **C_T_TLTS_MDL_2_DEC** (decrement).
    *   The results of these two sums are fed into the first switch block. The control input for this switch is **<LV_CON_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>** (the output from the large `AND` gate in step 1).
        *   If **<LV_CON_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>** is TRUE (operating conditions are stable), the switch selects the incremented temperature (`<T_TLTS_MDL_2> + C_T_TLTS_MDL_2_INC`).
        *   If **<LV_CON_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>** is FALSE (operating conditions are not stable), the switch selects the decremented temperature (`<T_TLTS_MDL_2> - C_T_TLTS_MDL_2_DEC`).
        This mechanism dynamically adjusts a "tracked" temperature value based on the stability of the overall operating environment.
    *   The output of this first switch is then fed into a second switch block, along with the original input **<T_TLTS_MDL_2>**. The control input for this second switch is "Check == 0".
        *   If "Check == 0" is TRUE, the original input **<T_TLTS_MDL_2>** is passed through. This acts as a reset or bypass mechanism under specific check conditions.
        *   If "Check == 0" is FALSE, the output from the first switch (the dynamically adjusted temperature) is passed through.
    *   The output of this second switch becomes the new **<T_TLTS_MDL_2>**, which likely represents the updated, continuously tracked air temperature value for stability evaluation. This value is likely fed back for the next iteration.
    *   Finally, this new **<T_TLTS_MDL_2>** is compared against **C_T_TLTS_MDL_2_MAX** using a `>=` operator.
    *   The boolean result of this comparison is **<LV_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>**. If TRUE, it indicates that the tracked air temperature has exceeded the maximum allowed threshold, signaling an unstable air temperature condition.


--- Page 37 ---

The provided image displays two distinct Simulink diagrams, likely representing sub-systems within a larger automotive control model, specifically related to an "AIRT, Air temperature sensor model."

## Function

The diagrams collectively perform a stability check for an input signal (likely temperature) by tracking its trailing maximum, minimum, and difference, and then using these values along with a counter to determine a specific stability state.

The first diagram ("Calculation of trailing pointers, temperature difference and counter for stability check") is responsible for:
1.  Continuously updating the maximum and minimum values observed in an input signal over time (trailing pointers).
2.  Calculating the difference between these trailing maximum and minimum values.
3.  Incrementing a stability check counter.

The second diagram ("Calculation of the state of the stability check") is responsible for:
1.  Evaluating two conditions: one based on the calculated temperature difference and another on the incremented counter.
2.  Based on these conditions, determining a stability state, which can be '2', '1', or maintain the previous state.

## Inputs

**For the first diagram:**
*   **`<TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The primary input signal, likely a temperature reading (e.g., from an air temperature sensor).
*   **`<TIG_STAB_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2>` (feedback)**: The maximum trailing pointer from the previous time step.
*   **`<TIG_STAB_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2>` (feedback)**: The minimum trailing pointer from the previous time step.
*   **`<CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>` (feedback)**: The stability counter value from the previous time step.

**For the second diagram:**
*   **`<TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The temperature difference calculated by the first diagram.
*   **`C_TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2`**: A constant threshold value for the temperature difference.
*   **`<CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The counter value calculated by the first diagram.
*   **`C_CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2`**: A constant threshold value for the counter.
*   **`<feedback>`**: The stability state from the previous time step (`STATE_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2`).

## Outputs

**From the first diagram:**
*   **`<TIG_STAB_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The updated maximum trailing pointer.
*   **`<TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The calculated difference between the updated maximum and minimum trailing pointers.
*   **`<TIG_STAB_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The updated minimum trailing pointer.
*   **`<CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The incremented stability counter value.

**From the second diagram:**
*   **`<STATE_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The calculated state of the stability check.

## Logic Flow

**Logic Flow for "3.7.2.2.1.1 Calculation of trailing pointers, temperature difference and counter for stability check"**

1.  **Maximum Trailing Pointer Update:** The current input signal `<TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_2>` is compared with the previous maximum trailing pointer `<TIG_STAB_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2>` in a `max` block. The output is the greater of the two, becoming the new `<TIG_STAB_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2>`.
2.  **Minimum Trailing Pointer Update:** Simultaneously, `<TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_2>` is compared with the previous minimum trailing pointer `<TIG_STAB_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2>` in a `min` block. The output is the smaller of the two, becoming the new `<TIG_STAB_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2>`.
3.  **Temperature Difference Calculation:** The newly updated `<TIG_STAB_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2>` and `<TIG_STAB_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2>` are fed into a subtraction block (`-`). The result, representing the difference between the maximum and minimum trailing pointers, is output as `<TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2>`.
4.  **Counter Increment:** A constant value of `1` is added to the previous stability counter value `<CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>` using an addition block (`+`). The result is the new, incremented `<CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`.

**Logic Flow for "3.7.2.2.1.2 Calculation of the state of the stability check"**

1.  **First Conditional Check (Temperature Difference):** The calculated temperature difference `<TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2>` is compared with a constant threshold `C_TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2` using a 'greater than' (`>`) comparator.
    *   **If True:** (i.e., `TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2 > C_TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2`), the system outputs a value of `2` (after passing through a state memory/delay block).
    *   **If False:** The output selection proceeds to the 'else' branch, which is fed by the result of the second conditional check.
2.  **Second Conditional Check (Counter):** The incremented counter `<CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>` is compared with a constant threshold `C_CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2` using a 'greater than or equal to' (`>=`) comparator.
    *   **If True:** (i.e., `CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2 >= C_CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2`), the system outputs a value of `1` (after passing through a state memory/delay block).
    *   **If False:** The system outputs the `<feedback>` signal (which is the previous state `<STATE_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`, also after passing through a state memory/delay block).
3.  **Merge:** The results from the conditional blocks (either '2', '1', or the previous state) are combined in a `Merge` block.
4.  **Output State:** The output of the `Merge` block becomes the current stability state, `<STATE_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`. This value is also fed back into the system to be used as `<feedback>` for the next time step.

In essence, the system monitors the temperature range and a counter. If the temperature difference exceeds a threshold, the state becomes '2'. If not, it then checks if the counter has reached its threshold. If so, the state becomes '1'. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged from its previous value. The delay blocks (V.6.0) are critical for ensuring proper state transitions and handling discrete time dynamics.


--- Page 39 ---

This image contains two Simulink diagrams, Figure 3.715 and Figure 3.716, which are part of an "Air temperature sensor model" system, likely for an automotive application. I will analyze each diagram separately as they represent distinct but related calculations.

---

## Analysis of Figure 3.715: Calculation of temperature offset value

### Function
This diagram's primary function is to calculate a "temperature offset value" (`<TIG_OFS_TLTS_MDL_2>`) and an associated "factor" (`<FAC_TLTS_MDL_2>`) for an air temperature model. These values are determined by various operational parameters and environmental conditions, using a series of 2D lookup tables, summations, and a final multiplication.

### Inputs
*   **`<TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV>`**: Temperature of a cold source (x-axis for `IP_FAC_TLTS_MDL_2`).
*   **`<TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV>`**: Temperature of a hot source (y-axis for `IP_FAC_TLTS_MDL_2`).
*   **`<N>`**: Engine speed (x-axis for `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_1`).
*   **`<M_GAS_TLTS_MDL_AIRT>`**: Mass of gas relevant to the air temperature model (y-axis for `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_1`).
*   **`<VS>`**: Vehicle speed (x-axis for `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_2`).
*   **`<FLOW_EGR_AIRT>`**: Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) flow relevant to air temperature (y-axis for `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_2`).
*   **(Unnamed x-axis input)**: An implicit x-axis input for `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_3`, typically another system parameter or internal signal.
*   **`<RATE_HEAT_IM>`**: Rate of heat transfer in the intake manifold (y-axis for `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_3`).

### Outputs
*   **`<FAC_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: A factor applied to the summed offsets.
*   **`<TIG_OFS_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The calculated ignition temperature offset value for the air temperature model.

### Logic Flow
1.  **Factor Calculation:**
    *   The `TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV` and `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV` inputs are used as x and y coordinates for a 2D lookup table named `IP_FAC_TLTS_MDL_2`.
    *   The interpolated `P_val` output from this lookup table directly provides the `<FAC_TLTS_MDL_2>` output.

2.  **Offset Contribution 1:**
    *   `N` (engine speed) and `M_GAS_TLTS_MDL_AIRT` are used as x and y coordinates for a 2D lookup table named `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_1`. This lookup table uses 16-bit interpolation.
    *   Its `P_val` output represents the first component of the total temperature offset.

3.  **Offset Contribution 2:**
    *   `VS` (vehicle speed) and `FLOW_EGR_AIRT` are used as x and y coordinates for a 2D lookup table named `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_2` (16-bit interpolation).
    *   Its `P_val` output represents the second component of the total temperature offset.

4.  **Offset Contribution 3:**
    *   An implicit x-axis input and `RATE_HEAT_IM` are used as x and y coordinates for a 2D lookup table named `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_3` (16-bit interpolation).
    *   Its `P_val` output represents the third component of the total temperature offset.

5.  **Summation of Offsets:**
    *   The three `P_val` outputs from the offset lookup tables (`IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_1`, `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_2`, `IP_TLTS_MDL_2_OFS_3`) are summed together using two cascaded sum blocks.

6.  **Final Offset Calculation:**
    *   The result of the offset summation is then multiplied by the previously calculated factor (`<FAC_TLTS_MDL_2>`).
    *   The output of this multiplication is the final `<TIG_OFS_TLTS_MDL_2>`, which is the temperature offset value.

## Analysis of Figure 3.716: Calculation of air temperature model value

### Function
This diagram calculates the final modeled air temperature value (`<TLTS_MDL_2_ACT>`) by combining a target temperature with an optional offset, applying rate and absolute limits, and also generating validation flags and state information based on whether these limits were active.

### Inputs
*   **`<TIG_OFS_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Ignition temperature offset (likely the output from Figure 3.715).
*   **`<TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Primary input ignition temperature for the model.
*   **`C_TLTS_MDL_2_DIF_LIM`**: A constant representing the maximum allowed difference (rate limit) for the model temperature.
*   **`TLTS_MDL_2_old`**: The model temperature from the previous time step (a feedback/state variable).
*   **`<LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD>`**: The previous validation status of the model (input, also an output).
*   **`<T_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The previous modeled temperature (input, also an output).
*   **`<TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Another previous modeled temperature or related value (input, also an output).

### Outputs
*   **`<TLTS_MDL_2_ACT>`**: The active/actual modeled air temperature value after rate and absolute limiting.
*   **`<LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD>`**: Updated validation status of the model (1 for valid/normal, propagated otherwise).
*   **`<T_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: A secondary modeled temperature or flag (0 for normal, propagated otherwise).
*   **`<STATE_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The operational state of the model (1 for normal, 2 for limited operation).
*   **`<TLTS_MDL_2>`**: A main modeled temperature or flag (0 for normal, propagated otherwise).

### Logic Flow
1.  **Target Temperature Calculation:**
    *   The `<TIG_OFS_TLTS_MDL_2>` and `<TIG_INP_TLTS_MDL_2>` inputs are summed. This produces a raw target air temperature.

2.  **Rate and Absolute Limiting:**
    *   The raw target temperature is fed as the 'u' input (new target) into a rate limiter block.
    *   The `TLTS_MDL_2_old` (previous model temperature) is used as `x_in` (the current value to limit from).
    *   The `C_TLTS_MDL_2_DIF_LIM` constant is used as the `Delta` parameter, defining the maximum allowed change per time step.
    *   The block also has `B_min` and `B_max` inputs, which define the absolute minimum and maximum bounds for the output.
    *   The output `x_out` of this block is the rate-limited and bounded temperature, which is designated as `<TLTS_MDL_2_ACT>`.
    *   An `OR` output from this block indicates if any of the rate or absolute limits were active (1 if active, 0 if not).

3.  **Output Validation and State Logic (using Switch blocks with `OR` as condition):**
    The `OR` signal from the rate limiter acts as the control input for several switch blocks. Based on the label `Check == 0` on the switches:
    *   If `OR == 0` (meaning no rate or absolute limits were active, i.e., the temperature change was within allowed bounds):
        *   `<LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD>` (validation status) is set to `1` (indicating normal/valid operation).
        *   `<T_TLTS_MDL_2>` (secondary temperature/flag) is set to `0`. (This likely indicates that this specific output is not active or relevant when no limits are hit, or it acts as a reset/flag).
        *   `<STATE_TLTS_MDL_2>` (model state) is set to `1` (indicating normal operation).
        *   `<TLTS_MDL_2>` (main temperature/flag) is set to `0`. (Similar to `<T_TLTS_MDL_2>`).
    *   If `OR != 0` (meaning one or more rate or absolute limits were active):
        *   `<LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD>` propagates its input value (the previous validation status is maintained).
        *   `<T_TLTS_MDL_2>` propagates its input value (the previous temperature/flag is maintained).
        *   `<STATE_TLTS_MDL_2>` is set to `2` (indicating that limits were active).
        *   `<TLTS_MDL_2>` propagates its input value (the previous temperature/flag is maintained).

This structure allows the model to output the primary calculated temperature (`<TLTS_MDL_2_ACT>`) and also provide detailed status information about its operation (whether it's running freely or being limited).

This is a Simulink diagram.

## Function

This Simulink subsystem, titled "Calculation when condition deactivated," serves as a default or fail-safe value generator for a module identified as "TLTS_MDL_2" (likely "Temperature-Limit-Throttle-System Model 2" or similar, given the "Air temperature sensor model" context). Its primary function is to provide a consistent set of output signals when the TLTS Model 2 is in a deactivated state. It largely sets most operational parameters to a default value of zero, while potentially passing through certain identification data or setting specific limit values.

## Inputs

1.  **`<TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The main input, likely a bus or structured signal containing various data related to TLTS Model 2.
2.  **`phys_max`**: A constant or parameter representing a physical maximum value, used for limiting or setting a default max.
3.  **`phys_min`**: A constant or parameter representing a physical minimum value, used for limiting or setting a default min.
4.  **`0` (Multiple Instances)**: Constant zero values used to set various output signals to a default of zero.
5.  **`V.6.1`, `V.6.4`, `V.6.7`**: These labels likely refer to specific constants, gain values, or block parameters used in the calculations or as labels for the logic paths.

## Outputs

All outputs are bundled into a single output port named `mdl_2_deac`, which is likely a bus containing the following individual signals:

1.  **`<TLTS_MDL_2>`**: The original input bus, potentially passed through directly or with minor modifications.
2.  **`TLTS_MDL_2_ACT`**: An activation flag for TLTS Model 2, which would likely indicate a deactivated state (e.g., `FALSE` or `0`) in this context.
3.  **`<TIG_STAB_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Minimum stable temperature ignition value for TLTS Model 2.
4.  **`<TIG_STAB_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Maximum stable temperature ignition value for TLTS Model 2.
5.  **`<TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Difference in stable temperature ignition value for TLTS Model 2.
6.  **`<CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Counter or control value for stable temperature ignition for TLTS Model 2.
7.  **`<STATE_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: State of stable temperature ignition for TLTS Model 2.
8.  **`<STATE_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: General state of TLTS Model 2.
9.  **`<T_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Temperature value for TLTS Model 2.
10. **`<LV_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Vehicle stability level for TLTS Model 2.
11. **`<LV_CDN_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Conditional vehicle stability level for TLTS Model 2.
12. **`<TIG_OFS_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Ignition offset for TLTS Model 2.
13. **`<FAC_TLTS_MDL_2>`**: Factor for TLTS Model 2.
14. **`<LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD>`**: Validity flag for TLTS Model 2.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow defines how the outputs are determined when the TLTS Model 2 condition is deactivated:

1.  **Primary Input Reception**: The subsystem receives the main input bus, `<TLTS_MDL_2>`.
2.  **Pass-through of Base Module Data**: A direct connection from the `<TLTS_MDL_2>` input to an output signal of the same name suggests that the core data structure or identification within the bus is passed through, even in the deactivated state.
3.  **Deactivation Flag Generation**: The `<TLTS_MDL_2>` input is also routed through a block labeled `V.6.1` to produce the `TLTS_MDL_2_ACT` output. In a "deactivated" context, this block likely assigns a value (e.g., `0` or `false`) to `TLTS_MDL_2_ACT` to explicitly indicate that the module is not active.
4.  **Min/Max Stability Value Calculation/Assignment**:
    *   The `phys_min` value is processed with the `<TLTS_MDL_2>` input through a block labeled `V.6.7` to yield `<TIG_STAB_MIN_TLTS_MDL_2>`. This block likely either extracts a minimum stability value from the input and ensures it's not below `phys_min`, or directly assigns `phys_min` as the output in the deactivated state.
    *   Similarly, `phys_max` is processed with `<TLTS_MDL_2>` via another `V.6.7` block to produce `<TIG_STAB_MAX_TLTS_MDL_2>`. This would likely ensure the maximum stability value does not exceed `phys_max` or use `phys_max` as a default.
    *   `<TIG_STAB_DIF_TLTS_MDL_2>` is derived from `<TLTS_MDL_2>` using a `V.6.1` block, possibly indicating a difference calculation that's still performed or defaulted based on the input.
5.  **Defaulting to Zero for Most Parameters**: A significant number of output signals are directly connected to constant `0` blocks, often labeled `V.6.4`. This indicates a clear strategy to set these operational values to a safe, inactive default:
    *   `<CTR_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`
    *   `<STATE_TIG_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`
    *   `<STATE_TLTS_MDL_2>`
    *   `<T_TLTS_MDL_2>`
    *   `<LV_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`
    *   `<LV_CDN_VEH_STAB_TLTS_MDL_2>`
    *   `<TIG_OFS_TLTS_MDL_2>`
    *   `<FAC_TLTS_MDL_2>`
    *   `<LV_TLTS_MDL_2_VLD>` (likely a validity flag, defaulted to `0` meaning invalid/deactivated).
6.  **Output Bus Assembly**: Finally, all the processed, passed-through, and defaulted individual signals are collected and organized into a single output bus, which then exits the subsystem via the `mdl_2_deac` output port. The block with `1` inside it represents a Bus Creator or Mux that combines these disparate signals into the final structured output.

This image is a Simulink/Stateflow diagram representing a software component for an automotive system.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram, titled "AIRT: Ambient air temperature calculation," is to accurately determine and manage the Ambient Air Temperature (AAT) within an automotive system. It takes various raw sensor inputs, system states, and control commands, performs complex estimation, filtering, and validation logic, and then outputs estimated AAT values, associated states, gradients, and diagnostic information. The system also incorporates non-volatile memory (NVMY) handling for persistent storage of critical temperature parameters.

## Inputs
The system receives a wide array of inputs, grouped into logical bundles:

*   **Activation/Control Signals:**
    *   `_lv_igk`: Main ignition/activation signal.

## Outputs
The system produces various outputs, providing current AAT estimates, states, and supporting information:

*   **Estimated and Filtered AAT Values:**
    *   `<TAA>`: The primary estimated Ambient Air Temperature.
    *   `<TAA_ESTIM>`: Another form of estimated AAT value.
    *   `LV_TAA_ESTIM_FIL_COLD`: Filtered AAT value, possibly specific to a "cold" state or calculation path.
    *   `LV_TAA_ESTIM_TRAN`: Transferred AAT estimate (e.g., for transmission to other modules).
    *   `<TAA_MES_SAMPLE>`: A sampled AAT measurement.

*   **AAT Gradients:**

    *   `LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM`: Vehicle speed threshold used for AAT estimation.
    *   `T_VS_TAA_ESTIM`: A specific temperature related to vehicle speed and TAA estimation.
    *   `fc_OPM_100MS`: Function call trigger for a 100ms periodic operation.
    *   `fc_OPM_1S`: Function call trigger for a 1s periodic operation.

## Logic Flow

1.  **System Activation and Recurrence Control (Top Block):**
    *   The `_lv_igk` signal initiates the "Recurrence" block (likely a Stateflow chart). This block defines the system's operational modes, initialization sequence, and periodic execution rates.
    *   **Initialization (Init):** During initialization, it sets up initial values for control signals like `IGK_ON`, `NVMSTO`, `NVMRES`, `CLRFMY`, `ESERU`, and `DCON`. These are bundled into an `ini` signal.
    *   **Activation Logic:** The "Activation" state in the Recurrence block determines when the main AAT calculation logic is active, based on conditions such as `100MS::STATE_TAA_ESTIM==B4&&LV_IGK==1` (a specific AAT estimation state and ignition status) and `STATE_TAA_ESTIM~=B8`.
    *   **Deactivation:** If activation conditions are not met, the system might enter a deactivation state.
    *   **Periodic Triggers:** It generates periodic triggers: `fc_OPM_100MS` (every 100 milliseconds) and `fc_OPM_1S` (every 1 second), which synchronize the execution of downstream blocks.

2.  **Input Conditioning and Parameter Management (OPM X.1 Block):**
    *   A large array of input signals (raw sensor data, filtered values, various status flags, and control commands) are gathered and multiplexed.
    *   These signals, along with the `ini` bundle from the "Recurrence" block, are fed into the "OPM X.1" (Operational Parameter Management or similar) block.
    *   OPM X.1 likely performs initial checks, validation, and preparation of these diverse inputs, transforming them into a consolidated `input` bundle for the core AAT calculation. It also provides a `feedback` signal, suggesting a control loop or state-dependent processing.

3.  **Core Ambient Air Temperature Calculation (OPM X.2 Block):**
    *   The "OPM X.2" block is the central computational unit. It receives the `input` bundle from OPM X.1 and the `feedback` signal, along with the periodic triggers `fc_OPM_100MS` and `fc_OPM_1S`.
    *   Inside OPM X.2, the actual AAT estimation, filtering, and state machine logic (represented by `fc()` and `ogm` functions/subsystems) are executed.
    *   This block is responsible for processing the raw and pre-processed AAT data, calculating gradients, evaluating various system states, and determining the final estimated Ambient Air Temperature.
    *   **NVMY Handling:** Based on the accompanying text, OPM X.2 (or a sub-component within it) handles reading and writing NVMY data. Specifically, `TAA` (the estimated AAT) and `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` are saved to EEPROM (Non-Volatile Memory) when commanded (e.g., via `_lc_NVMSTO`) and loaded during initialization.

4.  **Output Generation and Reporting (Right Side):**
    *   The processed results from OPM X.2 are then presented as the system's outputs. These include the primary estimated AAT (`<TAA>`), various filtered AAT values, status flags (`<STATE_TAA>`, `<TAA_ST>`), diagnostic codes (`<TAA_ST_DC>`), calculated gradients, and specific system parameters like `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC`.
    *   These outputs are available for other vehicle control units, display interfaces, and diagnostic systems.

The image provided is a Simulink diagram.

## Function
This Simulink model manages the ambient air temperature (`TAA`) value and its associated validity/status flags within an automotive system. Its primary functions include:
1.  **Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) Management:** Storing and retrieving `TAA` and its "last valid status" flag (`LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC`) from NVM to ensure persistence across power cycles.
2.  **Runtime TAA Selection:** Dynamically selecting the current `TAA` value based on measured sensor input validity or a fallback manual/default value.
3.  **Conditional Flag Management:** Allowing external signals to clear or initialize the validity flag under specific conditions.
4.  **Reset Initialization:** Providing specific logic for initializing various `TAA`-related status flags (`TAA_ST`, `TAA_ST_DC`, `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC`) during a system reset (RST), taking into account factors like hot source temperatures.

## Inputs
The system takes the following inputs:

*   **`<TAA>`:** The current ambient air temperature value, or the value to be stored/processed.
*   **`LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC`:** A boolean flag indicating the "last valid status" or a specific condition related to the `TAA` estimation.
*   **`<TAA_MES>`:** The measured ambient air temperature from a sensor.
*   **`<LV_TAA_MES_VLD>`:** A boolean flag indicating the validity of the `<TAA_MES>` input.
*   **`C_TAA_MAN`:** A constant, likely representing a manual or default ambient air temperature value.
*   **`<LC_AD_CLR_AIRT>`:** A control signal (likely boolean or enum) to trigger a clear/reset of AIRT-related data.
*   **`clc_NVMSTO_`:** A control signal (e.g., boolean) to enable the NVM store operation.
*   **`clc_NVMRES_`:** A control signal (e.g., boolean) to enable the NVM read/reset operation.
*   **`clc_NVMINI_`:** A control signal (e.g., boolean) for specific NVM initialization scenarios.
*   **`<TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV>`:** A temperature value from a potential hot source (e.g., engine, exhaust) which may influence TAA validity.
*   **`C_TEMP_HOT_SRC_MAX_TAA_ESTIM`:** A constant threshold for the hot source temperature comparison.

## Outputs
The primary output of the system is:

*   **`ini`:** A bus signal (indicated by `BusMerge` blocks in both figures) which bundles together the initialized/updated ambient air temperature status and validity flags (`TAA_ST`, `TAA_ST_DC`, `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC`, and potentially the `TAA` value itself, though not explicitly shown as part of the output bus members). This bus likely represents the persistent or initialized state of the AIRT system.
*   **`f()`:** (In Figure 3.9.6) This indicates a function call, suggesting that the initialization logic in Figure 3.9.6 is part of a larger function executed during system reset.

## Logic Flow

The system's logic can be divided into two main parts: runtime management (Figure 3.9.5) and reset initialization (Figure 3.9.6).

**I. Runtime Management (Figure 3.9.5):**

1.  **TAA Input Selection:**
    *   A switch block takes `<LV_TAA_MES_VLD>` as its control input.
    *   If `<LV_TAA_MES_VLD>` is true, the system selects `<TAA_MES>` (measured temperature).
    *   If `<LV_TAA_MES_VLD>` is false, it selects `C_TAA_MAN` (manual/default temperature).
    *   The output of this switch updates the internal `<TAA>` signal, which is then used by other parts of the diagram.

2.  **Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) Operations:**
    *   **NVM Store:** When the `clc_NVMSTO_` signal is active, the current `<TAA>` and `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` values are written to non-volatile memory via `NVMY[store]` blocks.
    *   **NVM Read/Initialization:** When the `clc_NVMRES_` signal is active, `NVMY[read/init]` blocks attempt to read `<TAA>` and `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` from NVM. If NVM data is not available or valid, these blocks provide default or initial values.

3.  **Conditional Validity Flag Clearing/Initialization:**
    *   The `<LC_AD_CLR_AIRT>` signal is compared to `1`.
    *   A `cond_if` block uses the result of this comparison as its condition. If `LC_AD_CLR_AIRT == 1` is true, the `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` output is set to `0` (clearing the flag). Otherwise, it passes through the value of `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` derived from the NVM read/initialization path.
    *   A second switch, controlled by `clc_NVMINI_` and possibly an internal `Check == 0` condition, further influences the `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` value, providing an initialization path for this flag, potentially setting it to `0`.

4.  **Output Bus Assembly:**
    *   Values from the NVM store path, NVM read/initialization path, and the conditional flag logic are merged using `Merge` blocks (`V.6.7`, `V.6.6`).
    *   These merged signals, representing the updated `TAA` state and flags, are then combined into a single `ini` bus via a `BusMerge` block, representing the overall state of the ambient air temperature system.

**II. Initialization at RST (Figure 3.9.6):**

1.  **TAA Status Derivation:**
    *   The input `<TAA>` is processed by blocks `V.6.8` to derive two status signals: `TAA_ST` and `TAA_ST_DC`. The exact logic within `V.6.8` (e.g., range checks, filters) is not visible but implies specific computations based on `<TAA>`.

2.  **`LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` Initialization Logic:**
    *   A comparison is performed: `<TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV>` is checked if it's greater than or equal to `C_TEMP_HOT_SRC_MAX_TAA_ESTIM`. This identifies if a critical hot source condition is present.
    *   This comparison result is fed into an `OR` gate, along with the initial `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` input.
    *   The output of the `OR` gate acts as the condition for a `cond_if` block (`V.6.4`).
    *   If the `OR` condition is true (meaning either the initial `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` is set, or a hot source is detected), the `cond_if` block outputs `1`. Otherwise, it passes through its alternate input (which is implied to be the original `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` value, if not `1`, or potentially `0`). This logic effectively sets `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` to `1` if a hot source is active during reset or if the flag was already set.

3.  **Initialization Output Bus Assembly:**
    *   The derived `TAA_ST`, `TAA_ST_DC`, and the initialized `LV_TEMP_MAX_TAA_ESTIM_2_LST_DC` are bundled into an `ini` bus using a `BusMerge` block. This `ini` bus represents the complete initialized state of key ambient air temperature status flags after a system reset. The `f()` block indicates that this initialization process is part of a called function.

This image displays three distinct Simulink diagram sections, each representing a part of an automotive ambient air temperature calculation system (AIRT).

## Function
The primary function of these Simulink diagrams is to manage, initialize, and calculate the Ambient Air Temperature (TAA) within an automotive system. This involves:
1.  **Initialization (at RST and IGKON):** Setting default or initial values for various Ambient Air Temperature Estimation (TAA_ESTIM) parameters when the system resets or the ignition turns on.
2.  **Calculation (at CLFMY):** Dynamically selecting or calculating the current Ambient Air Temperature based on measured values, validity flags, manual overrides, and a specific climatic function module switch.
3.  **Calculation (at ES2ERU):** Extracting and outputting the current status of the Ambient Air Temperature system.

## Inputs
Each section has specific inputs, which collectively contribute to the overall TAA determination:

**Section 3.9.1.3: Initialization at RST and IGKON**
*   `<TAA>` (Bus): A data bus likely containing various current TAA-related signals.
*   `0` (Constant): A constant value of zero, used for initialization.
*   `INIT_WAKE_UP` (Signal): A control signal indicating a system wake-up for initialization.

**Section 3.9.1.4: Calculation at CLFMY**
*   `<TAA_MES>` (Bus): A data bus containing measured Ambient Air Temperature data.
*   `LV_TAA_MES_VID` (Signal): A validity or status signal associated with the measured TAA.
*   `C_TAA_MAN` (Constant/Signal): A constant or manually input TAA value.
*   `<TAA>` (Bus): A data bus representing the current or previous TAA value used as a fallback or input.
*   `LC_TAA_CLC_FMY_SWI` (Signal): A control signal for a switch, likely from a Climatic Function Module (CLFMY).

**Section 3.9.1.5: Calculation at ES2ERU**
*   `<TAA>` (Bus): A data bus carrying the current Ambient Air Temperature value and related states.

## Outputs
Each section produces a specific output, typically aggregated into a bus named `ini` (likely representing "initial values" for section 3.9.1.3, and "current/resultant values" for the other sections).

**Section 3.9.1.3: Initialization at RST and IGKON**
*   `ini` (Output Bus): A structured bus containing all the initialized TAA estimation parameters, ready for subsequent calculations. This includes `T_VS_TAA_ESTIM`, `LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI`, `LV_TAA_ESTIM_TRAN`, `LV_TAA_MES_GRD_DEC`, `LV_TAA_MES_GRD_INC`, `T_TAA_MES_GRD`, `TAA_MES_GRD`, `TAA_MES_SAMPLE`, `STATE_TAA`, `LV_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA_tmp`, `LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM`, and `STATE_TAA_ESTIM`.

**Section 3.9.1.4: Calculation at CLFMY**
*   `ini` (Output Bus/Signal): The selected or calculated Ambient Air Temperature value, represented as `<TAA>`, based on the logic within this module.

**Section 3.9.1.5: Calculation at ES2ERU**
*   `ini` (Output Signal): The `TAA_ST` (Ambient Air Temperature Status) signal, indicating the current state of the TAA system.

## Logic Flow

**Section 3.9.1.3: Initialization at RST and IGKON**
1.  The `<TAA>` input bus is passed through a Bus Selector (V.6.8) to extract specific signals, including `TAA_ESTIM` and `INIT_WAKE_UP`.
2.  A constant `0` and the extracted `TAA_ESTIM` signal (and its constituent elements like `T_VS_TAA_ESTIM`, etc.) are prepared as inputs.
3.  The `INIT_WAKE_UP` signal, potentially along with the constant `0` and a default `STATE_TAA_ESTIM` (V.6.12), influences the initialization of `STATE_TAA_ESTIM`.
4.  All these processed signals and constant values are then combined by a Bus Creator (the large black block with multiple inputs) to form the structured `ini` output bus, which represents the initial state of various TAA estimation parameters.

**Section 3.9.1.4: Calculation at CLFMY**
1.  The `<TAA_MES>` input bus is processed by a Bus Selector to extract `LV_TAA_MES_VID` (validity of measured TAA).
2.  `C_TAA_MAN` (manual TAA) and `LC_TAA_CLC_FMY_SWI` (Climatic Function Module switch) are inputs to "Check >= 0" blocks (V.6.10), which likely condition them for use in a switch.
3.  A main Switch block (the three-input block) determines its output based on a control signal. The inputs to this switch are `C_TAA_MAN` (one path) and `<TAA>` (another path), both potentially conditioned by the "Check >= 0" logic. The control signal for this switch is `LC_TAA_CLC_FMY_SWI`.
4.  The output of this switch, which is the selected or calculated `<TAA>` value for this module, is then routed to the `ini` output port.

**Section 3.9.1.5: Calculation at ES2ERU**
1.  The `<TAA>` input bus is passed through a Bus Selector (V.6.8).
2.  From the bus, the `TAA_ST` (Ambient Air Temperature Status) signal is extracted.
3.  This `TAA_ST` signal is directly connected to the `ini` output port, providing the current status of the TAA system.

This image is a Simulink diagram.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is the **calculation and management of Ambient Air Temperature (TAA)** within an automotive system. It determines the availability of TAA sensors, coordinates various temperature inputs (measured, estimated, configured) to produce a robust ambient temperature value, calculates the operational state of the TAA system, and generates detailed TAA status information.

## Inputs
The system receives data through two primary bus inputs:

1.  **`inputs` Bus:**
    *   `<NC_TAA_SENS_USE>`: Number of TAA sensors currently in use.
    *   `<TAA_SENS_CONF>`: Configuration setting for TAA sensors.
    *   `<TAA_MES>`: Raw measured ambient air temperature value.
    *   `<LV_TAA_MES_VLD>`: Validity status of the measured TAA value.

2.  **`feedback` Bus:**
    *   `<TAA_ESTIM>`: An estimated ambient air temperature value, likely from a previous cycle or another estimation module.
    *   `<NC_TAA_SENS_USE>`: (Potentially a redundant input or used for internal consistency checks)
    *   `<LV_TAA_SENS_ENA>`: Enable status for TAA sensors.
    *   `<LV_TAA_CUS_ACT>`: Customer activation status related to TAA.
    *   `<TAA_CUS>`: A customer-defined or overridden TAA value.
    *   `<LV_TAA_MDL_VLD>`: Validity of a TAA model value.
    *   `<TAA_SENS_CONF>`: (Potentially a redundant input or used for internal consistency checks)
    *   `<NC_TAA_BOL>`: Break-over-limit configuration for TAA.
    *   `<NC_TAA_TOL>`: Tolerance values for TAA.
    *   `<TAA>`: The previously calculated or coordinated ambient air temperature.
    *   `<STATE_TAA_ESTIM>`: The current state of TAA estimation.
    *   `<TAA_ST>`: Previous Ambient Air Temperature status.
    *   `<TAA_ST_DC>`: Previous Ambient Air Temperature status duty cycle (or similar diagnostic code).
    *   `<LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI>`: Initial CAN (Controller Area Network) status for TAA.
    *   `<LV_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA_Imp>`: Maximum allowed temperature difference influencing the TAA state.

## Outputs
The system produces a single output bus named `opm`, which contains the following calculated signals:

1.  **`TAA_SENS_AVAIL`**: Status indicating the availability of TAA sensors.
2.  **`TAA`**: The final, coordinated ambient air temperature value.
3.  **`STATE_TAA`**: The current operational state of the ambient air temperature system.
4.  **`TAA_ST`**: The current status of the Ambient Air Temperature.
5.  **`TAA_ST_DC`**: The current status duty cycle or diagnostic code for TAA.
6.  **`LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI`**: The initial CAN status of TAA.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow can be broken down into four main parallel processing paths that converge into a single output bus:

1.  **Sensor Availability Determination (TAA_SENS_AVAIL - X.2.1):**
    *   The `inputs` bus provides `<NC_TAA_SENS_USE>` and `<TAA_SENS_CONF>`.
    *   These signals are evaluated using comparison (`== 1`, `== 2`) and logical (`OR`, `AND`) blocks to determine specific sensor configurations or counts.
    *   An `If` block (`cond_if V.6.4`) further processes these logical conditions.
    *   The outcome of this logical processing, along with `<TAA_MES>` and its validity `<LV_TAA_MES_VLD>`, are fed into the `TAA_SENS_AVAIL` subsystem (X.2.1).
    *   This subsystem also receives `C_TAA_MAN` (likely a manual TAA control signal) and `NO_SENS` (a status from the `STATE_TAA_ESTIM` module).
    *   The `TAA_SENS_AVAIL` subsystem computes and outputs the sensor availability status.

2.  **Ambient Air Temperature Coordination (TAA_COORDINATION - X.2.2):**
    *   A comprehensive set of inputs related to temperature values, configurations, and enable/validity flags are extracted from both the `inputs` and `feedback` buses. These include `<TAA_ESTIM>`, `<NC_TAA_SENS_USE>`, `<LV_TAA_SENS_ENA>`, `<LV_TAA_CUS_ACT>`, `<TAA_CUS>`, `<LV_TAA_MDL_VLD>`, `<TAA_SENS_CONF>`, `<NC_TAA_BOL>`, `<NC_TAA_TOL>`, and the previously calculated `<TAA>`.
    *   These signals are bundled and fed into the `TAA_COORDINATION` subsystem (X.2.2).
    *   This subsystem is responsible for consolidating and arbitrating between the various temperature sources and validity flags to produce a robust and reliable ambient air temperature, `TAA`.

3.  **State Calculation for TAA (CLC_STATE_TAA - X.2.3):**
    *   Another group of signals, including `<STATE_TAA_ESTIM>`, `<NC_TAA_SENS_USE>`, `<LV_TAA_SENS_ENA>`, `<LV_TAA_CUS_ACT>`, `<LV_TAA_MDL_VLD>`, `<TAA_SENS_CONF>`, `<TAA_MES>`, and `<LV_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA_Imp>`, are extracted from the input buses.
    *   These inputs are fed into the `CLC_STATE_TAA` subsystem (X.2.3).
    *   This subsystem determines the overall operational state of the TAA system (`STATE_TAA`), which might include states like "initialized," "valid," "faulty," "estimated," etc.

4.  **Status Calculation for TAA (CLC_TAA_ST - X.2.4):**
    *   Signals related to the previous status (`<TAA_ST>`, `<TAA_ST_DC>`, `<LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI>`) from the `feedback` bus and the current measurement validity (`<LV_TAA_MES_VLD>`) from the `inputs` bus are fed into the `CLC_TAA_ST` subsystem (X.2.4).
    *   This subsystem computes and updates the various status flags for TAA, including `TAA_ST`, `TAA_ST_DC`, and `LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI`.

Finally, the individual outputs from `TAA_SENS_AVAIL` (X.2.1), `TAA_COORDINATION` (X.2.2), `CLC_STATE_TAA` (X.2.3), and `CLC_TAA_ST` (X.2.4) are collected by multiple `BusMerge` blocks (V.6.6) and consolidated into the single `opm` output bus. The `fc()` annotations suggest the presence of function calls or lookup tables within the subsystems for specific data processing.

This image is indeed a Simulink-like diagram, likely representing a control algorithm for an automotive system.

## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to calculate or estimate the **Ambient Air Temperature (AIRT)**, labeled as `<TAA>`, under various operational conditions. It intelligently switches between using a directly measured temperature, a wake-up phase estimation, a normal operation estimation, or a post-wake-up estimation, based on sensor validity and the system's current state. It also outputs a status signal indicating the validity of the selected TAA source.

## Inputs

*   **`LV_TAA_MES_VLD`**: Boolean signal indicating if the measured ambient air temperature is valid.
*   **`<input>` Bus**: A bus containing:
    *   **`TIG_TAA_ESTIM_CLC`**: Estimated intake gas temperature (from CLC - Closed Loop Control).
    *   **`TCO_SYS`**: System coolant temperature.
    *   **`LV_TCO_ENA_AIRT`**: Enable signal for using coolant temperature in AIRT calculation.
    *   **`LV_TIG_TAA_ESTIM_CLC`**: Enable signal for using intake gas temperature estimate from CLC.
*   **`<feedback>` Bus**: A bus containing:
    *   **`<TAA>`**: The previously estimated or calculated ambient air temperature, used as feedback for current estimation.
*   **`INIT_WAKE_UP`**: Boolean signal indicating if the system is currently in the wake-up phase.
*   **`STATE_TAA_ESTIM`**: A state variable or condition signal used to select between normal and post-wake-up estimation logic.
*   **Signals for `CLC_TAA_ESTIM_normal` subsystem**:
    *   **`VS`**: Vehicle speed.
    *   **`LV_VS_ENA_AIRT`**: Enable signal for using vehicle speed in AIRT calculation.
    *   **`T_ES`**: Engine speed temperature (or a temperature related to engine state/speed).
    *   **`LV_T_ES_VLD`**: Validity flag for `T_ES`.
    *   **`TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV`**: Temperature of a hot source (e.g., engine block) that might influence sensor readings.
    *   **`LV_TAA_ESTIM_FIL_EXT`**: External filtered ambient air temperature estimate.
    *   **`CALC_TAA_ESTIM_FIL_EXT`**: Calculated external filtered ambient air temperature estimate.
*   **Signals for `CLC_TAA_ESTIM_post_WKU` subsystem**:
    *   **`T_ES`**: Engine speed temperature.
    *   **`LV_T_ES_VLD`**: Validity flag for `T_ES`.
*   **`<TAA_MES>`**: Directly measured ambient air temperature (from a sensor).

## Outputs

*   **`<TAA>`**: The estimated ambient air temperature. This is the primary calculated value, represented by the thick blue line that also feeds back into the system.
*   **`clc_taa_estim_sens_ok`**: A boolean or status signal indicating whether the current ambient air temperature estimation/source is considered valid or 'OK'.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow for ambient air temperature calculation proceeds through a series of conditional checks and specialized estimation algorithms:

1.  **Check Measured TAA Validity (`LV_TAA_MES_VLD`):**
    *   The system first evaluates the `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` signal.
    *   **If `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` is true (Measured TAA is Valid):**
        *   The measured ambient air temperature `<TAA_MES>` is directly used as the estimated `<TAA>`.
        *   The `clc_taa_estim_sens_ok` signal is set to true, indicating a valid direct measurement.
    *   **If `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` is false (Measured TAA is Invalid or Unavailable):**
        *   The system proceeds to estimate the ambient air temperature using internal models, depending on the system's operational phase.

2.  **Determine Operational Phase for Estimation:**
    *   This path (when measured TAA is invalid) branches further based on the `INIT_WAKE_UP` signal.
    *   **Phase 1: Wake-Up Phase (`INIT_WAKE_UP` is true):**
        *   The `CLC_TAA_ESTIM_WKU_phase` subsystem is activated.
        *   This subsystem calculates `<TAA>` using inputs such as `TIG_TAA_ESTIM_CLC` (intake gas temperature), `TCO_SYS` (coolant temperature), and the previous `<TAA>` estimate (feedback).
        *   As described in the text, during wake-up (when CAN communication might be unavailable), it might rely on values from the last driving cycle (EEPROM) and heuristics involving intake gas temperature and coolant temperature to derive `<TAA>`.
        *   This subsystem also produces a `clc_taa_estim_sens_ok` status reflecting the validity of this wake-up phase estimation.
    *   **Phase 2: Not in Wake-Up Phase (`INIT_WAKE_UP` is false):**
        *   The system then checks the `STATE_TAA_ESTIM` signal to choose between two further estimation modes.
        *   **Sub-Phase A: Normal Estimation (`STATE_TAA_ESTIM` selects "normal"):**
            *   The `CLC_TAA_ESTIM_normal` subsystem is activated.
            *   This subsystem uses a comprehensive set of inputs including `VS` (vehicle speed), `T_ES` (engine speed temperature), `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV` (hot source temperature), external filtered TAA estimates, and the previous `<TAA>` estimate.
            *   This likely performs a more sophisticated and sensor-rich estimation for general driving conditions.
            *   It also produces a `clc_taa_estim_sens_ok` status.
        *   **Sub-Phase B: Post-Wake-Up Estimation (`STATE_TAA_ESTIM` selects "post_WKU"):**
            *   The `CLC_TAA_ESTIM_post_WKU` subsystem is activated.
            *   This subsystem uses a simpler set of inputs: `T_ES` and the previous `<TAA>` estimate.
            *   This mode likely caters to a transient period after the initial wake-up but before full normal operation, using a more streamlined estimation.
            *   It also produces a `clc_taa_estim_sens_ok` status.

3.  **Consolidate Outputs:**
    *   The final estimated ambient air temperature (`<TAA>`) is the output from whichever path (direct measurement, wake-up, normal, or post-wake-up) was selected by the conditional logic. This value is fed back into the system for the next calculation cycle.
    *   The `BusMerge` block collects the appropriate `clc_taa_estim_sens_ok` signal from the active path (either directly from `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` or from one of the estimation subsystems) and provides it as the overall `clc_taa_estim_sens_ok` output, indicating the validity of the chosen TAA source or estimation.

This image presents two distinct Simulink subsystems involved in an "Ambient air temperature calculation" (AIRT) system. Each subsystem addresses a specific aspect of temperature estimation and control.

## Function

The image contains two Simulink diagrams with distinct functions:

1.  **Figure 3.917: Calculation of gradient of measured ambient air temperature.**
    This subsystem's primary function is to calculate the instantaneous gradient (rate of change) of the measured ambient air temperature. It also processes this gradient, updates a sampled temperature value, and generates boolean flags indicating whether the gradient exceeds specific increasing or decreasing thresholds. A common control signal, `Check == 0`, gates several operations, suggesting conditional enabling or resetting of calculations.

2.  **Figure 3.918: Velocity counter for transition mode.**
    This subsystem's primary function is to manage a counter or state related to an estimated ambient air temperature, particularly during "transition modes." It employs a hysteresis mechanism based on vehicle velocity (`_VS`) to determine a state. This state, combined with a measured gradient flag, influences the calculation of an estimated ambient temperature (`<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM>`) and the generation of a transition flag.

## Inputs

**For Figure 3.917: Calculation of gradient of measured ambient air temperature**

*   `<T_TAA_MES_GRD>` (Previous Filtered Gradient): The value of the filtered ambient air temperature gradient from the preceding time step, used in a top branch that functions like a counter.
*   `<TAA_MES_SAMPLE>` (Previous Sampled Temperature): The value of the sampled measured ambient air temperature from the preceding time step, used as the reference for current gradient calculation.
*   `<TAA_MES>`: The current raw measured ambient air temperature.
*   `C_T_TAA_MES_GRD`: A constant used in conjunction with the previous filtered gradient, likely for thresholding or initialization.
*   `C_TAA_MES_GRD_THD_DEC`: A constant threshold for determining if the ambient air temperature gradient is significantly decreasing.
*   `C_TAA_MES_GRD_THD_INC`: A constant threshold for determining if the ambient air temperature gradient is significantly increasing.
*   `Check == 0` (Control Signal): A boolean signal (source not explicitly shown) that controls several switch blocks, effectively enabling or resetting different calculation paths or outputs.

**For Figure 3.918: Velocity counter for transition mode**

*   `_VS`: The current vehicle velocity.
*   `C_VS_MAX_HYS_TAA_ESTIM`: A constant defining the upper threshold for the velocity hysteresis, used to "set" the estimated temperature state.
*   `C_VS_MIN_HYS_TAA_ESTIM`: A constant defining the lower threshold for the velocity hysteresis, used to "reset" the estimated temperature state.
*   `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>` (Previous Threshold Flag): The boolean output from the SR Flip-Flop from the previous time step, representing the current state of the velocity-dependent estimated temperature threshold.
*   `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_INC>`: A boolean flag, likely originating from Figure 3.917, indicating if the measured ambient air temperature gradient is increasing.
*   `C_T_VS_INC_TAA_ESTIM`: A constant value added to the estimated ambient temperature when an increment condition is met.
*   `C_T_VS_DEC_TAA_ESTIM`: A constant value added (or subtracted, if negative) to the estimated ambient temperature when a decrement condition is met.
*   `C_T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_GRD_INC`: A constant threshold for comparing against the estimated ambient temperature to determine an increasing gradient state.
*   `C_T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_GRD_DEC`: A constant threshold for comparing against the estimated ambient temperature to determine a decreasing gradient or transition state.
*   `Check == 0` (Control Signal): A boolean signal (source not explicitly shown), likely shared with Figure 3.917, controlling switches that enable or reset parts of the estimated temperature calculation.

## Outputs

**From Figure 3.917: Calculation of gradient of measured ambient air temperature**

*   `<T_TAA_MES_GRD>` (Output Filtered Gradient/Counter): A processed value related to the ambient air temperature gradient, which behaves like a counter that increments when `Check == 0` is true and resets to `0` otherwise.
*   `<TAA_MES_SAMPLE>`: The updated value of the sampled measured ambient air temperature. If `Check == 0` is true, it is the current `<TAA_MES>`; otherwise, it is `0`.
*   `<TAA_MES_GRD>`: The calculated raw gradient of the measured ambient air temperature. If `Check == 0` is true, it is `0`; otherwise, it is the difference `<TAA_MES> - <TAA_MES_SAMPLE>_prev`.
*   `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_DEC>`: A boolean flag, set to true if the output `<TAA_MES_GRD>` is less than or equal to `C_TAA_MES_GRD_THD_DEC`.
*   `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_INC>`: A boolean flag, set to true if the output `<TAA_MES_GRD>` is greater than or equal to `C_TAA_MES_GRD_THD_INC`.

**From Figure 3.918: Velocity counter for transition mode**

*   `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>`: A boolean flag reflecting the state of the velocity hysteresis, indicating whether `_VS` is above its high threshold or below its low threshold (with hysteresis). This is a state output that also feeds back as an input.
*   `<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM>`: The estimated ambient temperature, which is the minimum of two conditionally incremented/decremented values.
*   `<LV_TAA_ESTIM_TRAN>`: A boolean flag, set to true if the estimated ambient temperature (`<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM>`) is less than or equal to `C_T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_GRD_DEC`, indicating a transition.
*   `<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_inverse>`: A value calculated as the sum of `<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM>` and a boolean `1` if `<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM>` is greater than or equal to `C_T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_GRD_INC`, otherwise `0`. This is likely a specific, non-mathematical "inverse" for control logic.

## Logic Flow

**For Figure 3.917: Calculation of gradient of measured ambient air temperature**

1.  **Raw Gradient Calculation:** The core gradient is calculated by subtracting the `Previous Sampled Temperature` (`<TAA_MES_SAMPLE>`) from the `Current Measured Temperature` (`<TAA_MES>`).
2.  **Gated Raw Gradient Output:** The raw gradient from step 1 is passed through a switch. If the `Check == 0` control signal is true, the output `<TAA_MES_GRD>` is set to `0`. Otherwise, it outputs the calculated raw gradient.
3.  **Sampled Temperature Update:** The `Current Measured Temperature` (`<TAA_MES>`) is selected by a switch. If `Check == 0` is true, `<TAA_MES>` becomes the new `<TAA_MES_SAMPLE>`. Otherwise, `<TAA_MES_SAMPLE>` is forced to `0`. This implies `Check == 0` acts as an "enable sampling" or "reset sample" control.
4.  **Filtered Gradient/Counter Update:** The `Previous Filtered Gradient` (`<T_TAA_MES_GRD>`) is incremented by `1`. This incremented value is then selected by a switch if `Check == 0` is true, becoming the new `<T_TAA_MES_GRD>` output. Otherwise, `<T_TAA_MES_GRD>` is reset to `0`. This section appears to implement a counter or gated cumulative value rather than a typical filtered gradient.
5.  **Gradient Threshold Flags:**
    *   The gated raw gradient (`<TAA_MES_GRD>` from step 2) is compared with `C_TAA_MES_GRD_THD_DEC` using a "less than or equal to" operator. The boolean result defines `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_DEC>`.
    *   The gated raw gradient (`<TAA_MES_GRD>` from step 2) is compared with `C_TAA_MES_GRD_THD_INC` using a "greater than or equal to" operator. The boolean result defines `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_INC>`.

**For Figure 3.918: Velocity counter for transition mode**

1.  **Hysteresis for Estimated Temperature Threshold:**
    *   The `Vehicle Velocity` (`_VS`) is continuously compared against two thresholds: `C_VS_MAX_HYS_TAA_ESTIM` (using `>=`) and `C_VS_MIN_HYS_TAA_ESTIM` (using `<`).
    *   These comparison results, along with the previous state of `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>`, feed an SR Flip-Flop (labeled `FF`). The `Q` output of this flip-flop becomes the current `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>`. This logic ensures that the flag `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>` is set (true) when `_VS` exceeds the max threshold and reset (false) only when `_VS` falls below the min threshold, providing hysteresis.
2.  **Transition Mode Activation:** The current state of `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>` is combined with the `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_INC>` flag (from Figure 3.917) using an OR gate. The output of this OR gate indicates a general "transition active" condition.
3.  **Estimated Temperature Adjustment:**
    *   **Conditional Increment/Decrement:** Two parallel paths calculate potential adjustments to an internal estimated temperature value (likely feeding back to `V.6.11`). In each path, an increment constant (`C_T_VS_INC_TAA_ESTIM`) or decrement constant (`C_T_VS_DEC_TAA_ESTIM`) is added to the previous estimated temperature value. Each result then passes through a switch controlled by `Check == 0`. If `Check == 0` is true, the adjusted value is passed; otherwise, `0` is passed.
    *   **Minimum Selection:** The outputs from both switched paths are fed into a `min` block, which selects the smaller of the two values. This chosen value becomes the updated `Estimated Ambient Temperature` (`<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM>`).
4.  **Transition Flag and Inverse Estimated Temperature:**
    *   **Transition Flag (`<LV_TAA_ESTIM_TRAN>`):** The `Estimated Ambient Temperature` (`<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM>`) is compared with `C_T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_GRD_DEC` using a "less than or equal to" operator. The boolean result is output as `<LV_TAA_ESTIM_TRAN>`.
    *   **Inverse Estimated Temperature (`<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_inverse>`):** The `Estimated Ambient Temperature` (`<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM>`) is compared with `C_T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_GRD_INC` using a "greater than or equal to" operator. The boolean result (which is `1` for true, `0` for false) is then added to `<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM>`. This sum is output as `<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_inverse>`.

This image is a Simulink diagram illustrating a control logic for estimating ambient air temperature.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to coordinate the calculation and filtering of an estimated ambient air temperature (`TAA_ESTIM`) and its associated operational state (`STATE_TAA_ESTIM`). It employs conditional logic to select between different filtering strategies (e.g., normal filtering, transition handling, freezing, or zero calibration) based on various vehicle operating conditions, such as vehicle speed and specific filter flags.

## Inputs
1.  `<LV_TAA_ESTIM_FIL_EXT>`: Logical variable, Ambient Air Temperature Estimate Filter Extended.
2.  `<LV_TAA_ESTIM_FIL_COLD>`: Logical variable, Ambient Air Temperature Estimate Filter Cold.
3.  `<LV_TAA_ESTIM_TRAN>`: Logical variable, Ambient Air Temperature Estimate Transition.
4.  `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>`: Logical variable, Vehicle Speed Threshold for TAA Estimate.
5.  `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_INC>`: Logical variable, Ambient Air Temperature Measured Gradient Increase.
6.  `<VS>`: Vehicle Speed.
7.  `<LV_VS_ENA_AIRT>`: Logical variable, Vehicle Speed Enable Ambient Air Temperature.
8.  `<CRLC_TAA_ESTIM_FIL_EXT>`: Calibration/Constant, related to extended filtering for Ambient Air Temperature Estimate.
9.  `<TAA>`: Measured Ambient Air Temperature (raw or primary).
10. `<TAA_MES>`: Measured Ambient Air Temperature (possibly a specific version or pre-processed).
11. `<T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_inverse>`: Constant or lookup table, related to the inverse function for Vehicle Speed and TAA Estimate.
12. `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_DEC>`: Logical variable, Ambient Air Temperature Measured Gradient Decrease.

## Outputs
1.  `<STATE_TAA_ESTIM>`: The operational state of the Ambient Air Temperature Estimate.
2.  `<TAA_ESTIM>`: The final Estimated Ambient Air Temperature.

## Logic Flow
The diagram implements a multi-branch conditional logic to determine the final estimated ambient air temperature and its state:

1.  **Initial Conditional Logic for Filter Mode Selection:**
    *   An `OR` block combines `<LV_TAA_ESTIM_FIL_EXT>` and `<LV_TAA_ESTIM_FIL_COLD>`. The output of this `OR` block acts as a condition (`cond_if`) for the first `if` subsystem (V.6.4), which directs the flow to specific branches (not fully visible) depending on whether an extended or cold-start filter mode is active.
    *   Simultaneously, `<LV_TAA_ESTIM_TRAN>`, `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>`, and `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_INC>` are processed. A "Check == 0" block (V.6.10) likely evaluates `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_INC>` against zero. The output of V.6.10, along with `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>`, forms the condition (`cond_if`) for the second `if` subsystem (V.6.4). This second `if` block, also with `else` paths, further refines the control signals based on vehicle speed thresholds and gradient increase conditions, potentially for transition phases.
    *   These `if` blocks and their `else` branches generate internal signals that influence the subsequent filtering subsystems and contribute directly to the merge points for the outputs.

2.  **Primary Ambient Air Temperature Filtering (`CLC_TAA_MES_FIL`):**
    *   The `CLC_TAA_MES_FIL` subsystem (X.2.1.1.3.3.1), likely an atomic subsystem or function call, performs a primary filtering operation.
    *   It takes multiple inputs including vehicle speed (`VS`), vehicle speed enable for AIRT (`LV_VS_ENA_AIRT`), a calibration value (`CRLC_TAA_ESTIM_FIL_EXT`), and the measured ambient air temperatures (`TAA`, `TAA_MES`). Its operation is also modulated by outputs from the preceding conditional logic.
    *   This block outputs a filtered ambient air temperature estimate and its corresponding state.

3.  **Ambient Air Temperature Transition/Gradient Filtering (`CLC_TAA_MES_TRAN`):**
    *   The `CLC_TAA_MES_TRAN` subsystem (X.2.1.1.3.3.2) handles specific conditions related to temperature transitions or gradient changes.
    *   It receives inputs such as `VS`, `LV_VS_ENA_AIRT`, `TAA`, `TAA_MES`, an inverse function/lookup (`T_VS_TAA_ESTIM_inverse`), and `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_DEC>` (gradient decrease). It is also influenced by the conditional logic from step 1.
    *   This block calculates an estimated temperature and state specifically tailored for transition periods or situations involving temperature gradient decreases.

4.  **State Output Determination (`STATE_TAA_ESTIM`):**
    *   A `Merge` block (V.6.2) combines the state outputs from `CLC_TAA_MES_FIL`, `CLC_TAA_MES_TRAN`, and potentially direct state values from the conditional `if` blocks.
    *   This `Merge` block selects the appropriate state based on which logic path is active, producing the final `<STATE_TAA_ESTIM>`.

5.  **Estimated Temperature Output Determination (`TAA_ESTIM`):**
    *   Similarly, another `Merge` block (V.6.2) combines the estimated temperature outputs from `CLC_TAA_MES_FIL`, `CLC_TAA_MES_TRAN`, and any direct temperature values from the `if` blocks.
    *   The output of this `Merge` block is then fed into a `min` block (V.6.11). This `min` block also receives an input from one of the conditional `if` blocks (V.6.4's output). This implies that the final `<TAA_ESTIM>` is the minimum of the value produced by the merged filtering/transition logic and a conditionally determined value. This step likely implements safeguards like freezing the temperature or forcing it to zero under specific conditions (e.g., low vehicle speed filtering as mentioned in the accompanying text), ensuring the estimate stays within bounds or follows specific behavior.

This image contains two Simulink-like diagrams. The primary diagram for analysis is titled "3.9.2.1.1.3.3.2 Coordination of transition states". The second diagram "3.9.2.1.1.3.3.2.1 Calculation of transition" appears to be a detailed view of a sub-component within the main diagram, specifically detailing how "transition" values and states are calculated. This analysis will focus on the main "Coordination of transition states" diagram.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to coordinate and manage the estimation of the Ambient Air Temperature (`<TAA_ESTIM>`) and its corresponding operational state (`<STATE_TAA_ESTIM>`). It achieves this by evaluating various input conditions, including measured temperature, current estimated temperature, and flags related to gradient detection and validation thresholds. The system decides whether to apply a ramp function or hold a state based on these conditions, ensuring a stable and reliable temperature estimate for automotive systems.

## Inputs
The key inputs to this system are:
*   `<TAA_MES>`: Measured Ambient Air Temperature (from a sensor).
*   `<TAA>`: The previously estimated or current Ambient Air Temperature, likely used for feedback and comparison.
*   `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_DEC>`: A boolean flag indicating if a decreasing gradient (rate of change) in the measured TAA is detected.
*   `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>`: A boolean flag indicating the validation status or threshold condition for the TAA estimation.
*   `_t_VS_TAA_ESTIM_inverse_`: A signal, possibly a boolean, representing the inverse of a TAA estimation validation status or threshold.
*   `HOLD_VAL`: A boolean flag that, when active, likely instructs the system to hold the current `STATE_TAA_ESTIM`.
*   `STATE_TAA_ESTIM`: The current or previous state of the TAA estimation, fed back into the system for state management.

## Outputs
The key outputs of this system are:
*   `<TAA_ESTIM>`: The estimated Ambient Air Temperature, which is the primary output of the calculation.
*   `<STATE_TAA_ESTIM>`: The current operational state of the Ambient Air Temperature estimation process (e.g., normal, transition, hold).

## Logic Flow
The logical flow of the diagram proceeds as follows:

1.  **Condition Evaluation for Transition Logic (Top Path):**
    *   The measured Ambient Air Temperature (`<TAA_MES>`) is compared against the current estimated Ambient Air Temperature (`<TAA>`) using a "greater than" (`>`) block (V.6.6).
    *   The `<LV_TAA_MES_GRD_DEC>` flag is inverted by a `NOT` block (V.6.8).
    *   The results from the `>` block and the `NOT` block are combined using an `AND` block (V.6.10).
    *   The output of the `AND` block, along with internal signals `cond_if` and `else` (V.6.4), drives an `If` block. This `If` block acts as a decision point, routing specific inputs to downstream processing based on whether the condition (`TAA_MES > TAA` AND `NOT LV_TAA_MES_GRD_DEC`) is true or false.

2.  **Transition State and Ramp Calculation (Middle-Bottom Subsystem):**
    *   The `CLC_TAA_MES_TRAN_STATE_and_RAMP` subsystem (V.6.5) receives inputs from the `If` block (V.6.4), `<TAA_MES>`, and `_t_VS_TAA_ESTIM_inverse_`.
    *   This subsystem is crucial for calculating values pertinent to system transitions. It produces two outputs:
        *   Output 1: A "ramp" value, likely a smoothed or rate-limited version of TAA, used for the `<TAA_ESTIM>` path.
        *   Output 2: A "transition state" value, used for the `<STATE_TAA_ESTIM>` path.
    *   (Note: The second diagram, "Calculation of transition," likely details the internal logic of this subsystem for calculating these ramp and state values during a transition phase).

3.  **Estimated TAA Calculation (`<TAA_ESTIM>` Path):**
    *   Inputs from the `If` block (V.6.4), `<LV_VS_THD_TAA_ESTIM>`, `_t_VS_TAA_ESTIM_inverse_`, and the 'ramp' output (output 1) from `CLC_TAA_MES_TRAN_STATE_and_RAMP` (V.6.5) are fed into a generic function block `f()`.
    *   Inside the `f()` block, there is a triangular symbol, typically representing a rate limiter or a ramp function. This suggests that the estimated TAA is smoothed or ramped based on the calculated ramp value and other conditions.
    *   The output of the `f()` block is then routed through a `Merge` block (V.6.2) to produce the final `<TAA_ESTIM>`.

4.  **State of Estimation Calculation (`<STATE_TAA_ESTIM>` Path):**
    *   A block (V.6.12) likely handles the current state, using the `HOLD_VAL` flag and the feedback `STATE_TAA_ESTIM`. This could represent a state memory or a "hold last valid state" mechanism.
    *   The 'transition state' output (output 2) from `CLC_TAA_MES_TRAN_STATE_and_RAMP` (V.6.5) provides a newly calculated state.
    *   These two state-related values (from V.6.12 and V.6.5) are processed by a block (V.6.7), which is depicted as a subtraction, but in a state logic context, it might function as a selector or implement specific state transition rules (e.g., choose new state unless `HOLD_VAL` is active).
    *   The result from V.6.7 is then routed through another `Merge` block (V.6.2) to produce the final `<STATE_TAA_ESTIM>`.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram, specifically Figure 3.9.24 "Ambient air temperature coordination," is to robustly determine and coordinate the Ambient Air Temperature (TAA) value for automotive systems. It acts as a sophisticated arbitration logic, selecting the most appropriate TAA source from various inputs (estimated, modeled, manual, or sensor-based) based on validity, configuration, and operational states. It also applies filtering, limiting, and tolerance adjustments to ensure the TAA output is stable, plausible, and adheres to calibrated parameters, preventing sudden, large changes.

## Inputs
The key inputs to this system are:
*   **`NC_TAA_SENS_USE`**: Boolean signal indicating whether a sensor value for TAA should be primarily used.
*   **`TAA_SENS_CONF`**: Configuration state of the TAA sensor (e.g., `1` for a specific configuration).
*   **`TAA_SENS_ENA`**: Enablement state of the TAA sensor (e.g., `2` for enabled).
*   **`TAA_ESTIM`**: An estimated value of the ambient air temperature.
*   **`TAA_MDL`**: A modeled value of the ambient air temperature.
*   **`TAA_MDL_VLD`**: Boolean signal indicating the validity of the `TAA_MDL` value.
*   **`C_TAA_DIF_LIM`**: Calibration value for limiting the difference during transitions (rate limiter).
*   **`C_TAA_MAN`**: Calibration value for a manual ambient air temperature.
*   **`LC_TAA_MAN`**: A potentially limited or processed version of the manual TAA value.
*   **`N_TAA_CUS_ACT`**: Boolean signal for customer activation of a specific TAA source (e.g., manual override).
*   **`NC_TAA_TOL_BOOL`**: Boolean signal to enable or disable the application of TAA tolerance.
*   **`C_TAA_TOL`**: Calibration value for the TAA tolerance.
*   **`u` and `y` (inputs to Max/Min blocks V.6.20)**: Signals defining the upper and lower limits for the final TAA value.
*   **`V.5.10`**: An unlabeled internal signal involved in sensor usage logic.

## Outputs
The primary output of this system is:
*   **`<TAA>`**: The coordinated and finalized Ambient Air Temperature value.

## Logic Flow
The logical flow of the diagram can be broken down into several stages:

1.  **Sensor Usage and Configuration Evaluation (Left-most 'if' block and associated logic):**
    *   The system first evaluates whether to use a sensor-based approach for TAA (`NC_TAA_SENS_USE`).
    *   If `NC_TAA_SENS_USE` is false (the 'else' branch), it then checks specific sensor conditions:
        *   `TAA_SENS_CONF` is compared to `1`.
        *   `TAA_SENS_ENA` is compared to `2`.
        *   These two comparison results are combined with an `OR` gate.
        *   The `OR` gate's output is then `AND`ed with an internal signal (`V.5.10`).
        *   This final `AND` result (`cond_if`) controls an inner 'if' block. If `cond_if` is true, `NC_TAA_SENS_USE` is output; otherwise, `V.5.10` is output. This complex logic determines an internal state for subsequent TAA source selection, likely indicating sensor health or preferred sensor usage.

2.  **Estimated vs. Modeled Value Selection:**
    *   An 'if' block evaluates `TAA_MDL_VLD`.
    *   If `TAA_MDL_VLD` is true, the `TAA_MDL` (modeled value) is selected.
    *   If `TAA_MDL_VLD` is false, `TAA_ESTIM` (estimated value) is selected as a fallback.
    *   This ensures that the modeled value is only used if it's deemed valid, otherwise, the estimated value is preferred.

3.  **Merging of TAA Sources:**
    *   A `Merge` block combines the outputs from different paths:
        *   The output of the sensor usage logic (from step 1, after passing through a `Check ~=0` block).
        *   The output of the Estimated vs. Modeled selection (from step 2, after passing through a `Check ~=0` block).
    *   This block effectively prioritizes or blends these different TAA sources, with the specific merging logic implicitly defined by the `Check ~=0` blocks and the preceding conditional logic.

4.  **Customer Activation / Manual Override:**
    *   An 'if' block checks the `N_TAA_CUS_ACT` signal.
    *   If `N_TAA_CUS_ACT` is true, the system selects `LC_TAA_MAN` (a limited manual temperature value), effectively overriding other sources.
    *   If `N_TAA_CUS_ACT` is false, the output from the `Merge` block (the arbitrated estimated/modeled/sensor value) is passed through.
    *   This provides a mechanism for a customer-specific or manual TAA input.

5.  **Difference Limiting and Filtering:**
    *   The selected TAA value from the previous stage enters a difference limiting section.
    *   A block `V.7.4` calculates a value based on `C_TAA_DIF_LIM`, `C_TAA_MAN`, and `LC_TAA_MAN`. This is likely used to establish boundaries or a reference for the difference limiter.
    *   The output then goes into a `Delta` block (`x_in`, `x_out`), which, combined with the inputs `LD` (lower limit) and `LU` (upper limit) from `V.7.19` (likely derived from `C_TAA_DIF_LIM` and the current value), acts as a rate limiter or filter. This prevents rapid, unrealistic changes in the TAA value, ensuring smooth transitions between different sources or states.

6.  **Tolerance Application:**
    *   Another 'if' block, controlled by `NC_TAA_TOL_BOOL`, determines if a tolerance should be applied.
    *   If `NC_TAA_TOL_BOOL` is true, the `C_TAA_TOL` calibration value is used, likely to adjust the TAA value by adding or subtracting a specified tolerance.
    *   If `NC_TAA_TOL_BOOL` is false, the value passes through without tolerance application.

7.  **Final Output Limiting:**
    *   The processed TAA value is then passed through `MX` (maximum) and `MN` (minimum) blocks.
    *   These blocks, with inputs `u` and `y` (presumably defining the upper and lower bounds), ensure that the final `<TAA>` output remains within predefined hard limits, preventing it from exceeding physically or functionally acceptable ranges.

The output of this final stage is the coordinated Ambient Air Temperature, `<TAA>`. Figure 3.9.23 then takes this `TAA`, `SENS_ERR`, and `STATE_TAA_ESTIM` to determine a `clc_taa_estim_sens_faulty` signal, which is a derived fault status.

This image is a Simulink diagram illustrating a logic flow for an "Ambient air temperature calculation."

## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to calculate and determine the final ambient air temperature value (`STATE_TAA`) by prioritizing various input sources and conditions. It employs a hierarchical decision-making process to select between manual overrides, customer-defined values, modeled values, estimated values, or measured sensor data, and provides an auxiliary output related to temperature difference.

## Inputs

The key inputs to this system are:

1.  **LC_TAA_MAN**: Boolean flag for "Manual Ambient Air Temperature" control.
2.  **LV_TAA_CUS_ACT**: Boolean flag for "Customer Ambient Air Temperature Active."
3.  **TAA_SENS_CONF**: Integer value indicating "Ambient Air Temperature Sensor Confidence" (e.g., 1 or 2 for valid/confident states).
4.  **LV_TAA_SENS_ENA**: Integer value indicating "Ambient Air Temperature Sensor Enable" state (e.g., 1 or 2 for different enable states).
5.  **LV_TAA_MDL_VLD**: Boolean flag indicating "Ambient Air Temperature Model Valid."
6.  **STATE_TAA_ESTIM**: An estimated ambient air temperature value.
7.  **INIT_WAKE_UP**: A status or value related to system initialization or wake-up.
8.  **TAA**: Raw ambient air temperature sensor reading.
9.  **TAA_MES**: Measured ambient air temperature value.
10. **C_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA**: A configuration parameter or constant representing the maximum allowable temperature difference for the state.

## Outputs

The key outputs from this system are:

1.  **STATE_TAA**: The calculated and selected ambient air temperature value. This output appears to be a numeric representation (using constants 5, 4, 3, 0, 1, or a boolean result) indicating the selected temperature or its source.
2.  **LV_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA_tmp**: An auxiliary output flag (value 1 or 2) indicating if the measured temperature difference (`TAA_MES` vs. `C_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA`) is within limits.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow determines the `STATE_TAA` output by following a hierarchical decision process:

1.  **Manual Override Check (Highest Priority):**
    *   The system first checks the input `LC_TAA_MAN`.
    *   **IF** `LC_TAA_MAN` is TRUE: `STATE_TAA` is set to the `Manual value` (constant `5`).
    *   **ELSE** (if `LC_TAA_MAN` is FALSE), the system proceeds to the next priority level.

2.  **Customer Override Check:**
    *   The system checks the input `LV_TAA_CUS_ACT`.
    *   **IF** `LV_TAA_CUS_ACT` is TRUE: `STATE_TAA` is set to the `Customer value` (constant `4`).
    *   **ELSE** (if `LV_TAA_CUS_ACT` is FALSE), meaning neither manual nor customer override is active, the system proceeds to evaluate sensor and model-based values. This state is implicitly handled by the `NC_TAA_SENS_USE` branch.

3.  **Sensor Validity Check:**
    *   A complex logical condition is evaluated to determine if sensor data can be used:
        *   `Sensor_OK_Condition = ( (TAA_SENS_CONF == 1) OR (TAA_SENS_CONF == 2) OR (LV_TAA_SENS_ENA == 2) ) AND (LV_TAA_SENS_ENA == 1)`
    *   **IF** `Sensor_OK_Condition` is FALSE: `STATE_TAA` is set to a `Substitute value` (constant `0`).
    *   **ELSE** (if `Sensor_OK_Condition` is TRUE), the system proceeds to check model validity.

4.  **Model Validity Check:**
    *   The system checks the input `LV_TAA_MDL_VLD`.
    *   **IF** `LV_TAA_MDL_VLD` is TRUE: `STATE_TAA` is set to the `Modeled value` (constant `3`).
    *   **ELSE** (if `LV_TAA_MDL_VLD` is FALSE), the system proceeds to check an estimated value.

5.  **Estimated Value Check:**
    *   The system compares `INIT_WAKE_UP` with `STATE_TAA_ESTIM`.
    *   **IF** `INIT_WAKE_UP == STATE_TAA_ESTIM` is TRUE: `STATE_TAA` is set to a `Substitute value` (constant `0`).
    *   **ELSE** (if `INIT_WAKE_UP == STATE_TAA_ESTIM` is FALSE), the system proceeds to evaluate measured sensor data.

6.  **Measured Value Condition Check:**
    *   An `OR` condition is evaluated: `Measured_Value_OK_Condition = (TAA > 2) OR (TAA_MES <= C_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA)`.
    *   **IF** `Measured_Value_OK_Condition` is TRUE: `STATE_TAA` is set to the boolean result of `TAA_MES <= C_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA` (i.e., `V.6.9` output). *Note: Graphically, the diagram shows the output of the comparison `TAA_MES <= C_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA` as the selected value, which results in a boolean (1 or 0) rather than an actual temperature. This may represent a state or a simplified representation.*
    *   **ELSE** (if `Measured_Value_OK_Condition` is FALSE): `STATE_TAA` is set to `1` (`Substitute value based on measured value`).

7.  **Auxiliary Output (`LV_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA_tmp`) Calculation:**
    *   This output is calculated independently from the `STATE_TAA` selection logic.
    *   The condition `TAA_MES <= C_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA` is evaluated.
    *   **IF** `TAA_MES <= C_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA` is TRUE: `LV_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA_tmp` is set to `2`.
    *   **ELSE**: `LV_TEMP_DIF_MAX_STATE_TAA_tmp` is set to `1`.

All the conditional branches for `STATE_TAA` feed into a `Merge` block, which consolidates the selected value into the final `STATE_TAA` output based on the priority established by the nested `cond_if` blocks.

This image displays a Simulink diagram, a graphical programming environment commonly used in automotive embedded systems development for modeling, simulating, and implementing control logic.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram, as indicated by the title "AIRT. Ambient air temperature calculation," is to manage and select the appropriate status and related diagnostic codes for an ambient air temperature signal. It determines whether to use current measured values/statuses or fallback/default values based on the validity of the ambient air temperature measurement. Specifically, it handles the logic for the CAN initial status of the ambient air temperature, the overall ambient air temperature status, and its associated duty cycle or diagnosis code.

## Inputs
*   **LV_TAA_MES_VLD**: (Local Variable - Ambient Air Temperature Measured Valid) A boolean signal indicating the validity of the measured ambient air temperature. This is a crucial condition for switching between measured and fallback values.
*   **LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI**: (Local Variable - Ambient Air Temperature Status CAN Initial) An initial or current status signal related to the CAN bus for ambient air temperature. This is used as an input to an internal state machine/logic block.
*   **<TAA>**: (Ambient Air Temperature) This likely represents the raw or processed ambient air temperature value or a primary status derived directly from the measurement.
*   **<TAA_ST>**: (Ambient Air Temperature Status) A general status signal for ambient air temperature, used as a fallback or as an input to derive other outputs.
*   **<TAA_ST_DC>**: (Ambient Air Temperature Status Duty Cycle / Diagnosis Code) A signal representing a duty cycle or diagnostic code associated with the ambient air temperature status. This is used as a fallback.

## Outputs
*   **LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI**: (Local Variable - Ambient Air Temperature Status CAN Initial) The processed or selected CAN initial status. This output determines if the CAN signal for ambient air temperature is considered initialized or valid.
*   **<TAA_ST>**: (Ambient Air Temperature Status) The final, selected ambient air temperature status.
*   **<TAA_ST_DC>**: (Ambient Air Temperature Status Duty Cycle / Diagnosis Code) The final, selected ambient air temperature status duty cycle or diagnosis code.

## Logic Flow

The diagram processes three distinct output signals, each with its own conditional logic:

1.  **Processing of `LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI` (Output):**
    *   The input `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` and `LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI` are fed into an internal block named `LC_TAA_ST_CAN_INI` (V.6.11). This block likely contains a state machine or specific logic to manage the CAN initial status based on measurement validity. It outputs `y` (a condition) and `x_out` (a value).
    *   The `y` output from `LC_TAA_ST_CAN_INI` is then passed through an `AND` gate (V.6.10). (Assuming the `AND` gate has another implicit 'true' input or acts as a buffer, making `y` its effective output).
    *   This `AND` gate's output serves as the condition for the top `cond_if` block (V.6.4).
    *   **If the condition is TRUE (output of `AND` is true):** The constant value `1` (V.6.11) is selected. This suggests that if the internal logic in `LC_TAA_ST_CAN_INI` deems the CAN initial status valid, the output `LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI` is explicitly set to `1` (true/valid).
    *   **If the condition is FALSE (else):** The `x_out` value from the `LC_TAA_ST_CAN_INI` block (V.6.11) is selected. This `x_out` typically represents the previous or a default invalid state of the CAN initial status.
    *   The selected signal passes through two `Merge` blocks (V.6.7 and V.6.2) to become the final `LV_TAA_ST_CAN_INI` output.

2.  **Processing of `TAA_ST` (Output):**
    *   The input `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` serves as the condition for the middle `cond_if` block (V.6.4).
    *   **If `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` is TRUE (measurement is valid):** The input signal `<TAA>` (Ambient Air Temperature) is selected. This implies that the actual measured temperature value or its primary status is used when the measurement is reliable.
    *   **If `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` is FALSE (else, measurement is invalid):** The input signal `<TAA_ST>` (Ambient Air Temperature Status) is selected. This serves as a fallback, where a default or previously known status is used if the current measurement is not valid.
    *   The selected signal then passes through two `Merge` blocks (V.6.7 and V.6.2), and a small unidentified block (V.6.8, possibly a pass-through or label point), before becoming the final `TAA_ST` output.

3.  **Processing of `TAA_ST_DC` (Output):**
    *   The input `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` also serves as the condition for the bottom `cond_if` block (V.6.4).
    *   **If `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` is TRUE (measurement is valid):** The input signal `<TAA_ST>` (Ambient Air Temperature Status) is selected. This suggests that if the measurement is valid, the general status signal is used to derive or represent the duty cycle/diagnosis code.
    *   **If `LV_TAA_MES_VLD` is FALSE (else, measurement is invalid):** The input signal `<TAA_ST_DC>` (Ambient Air Temperature Status Duty Cycle / Diagnosis Code) is selected. This acts as a fallback, maintaining a default or previously known duty cycle/diagnosis code when the current measurement is not valid.
    *   The selected signal passes through two `Merge` blocks (V.6.7 and V.6.2) to become the final `TAA_ST_DC` output.

In essence, this diagram implements a robust selection mechanism to ensure that the system always provides a relevant status and diagnostic code for ambient air temperature, prioritizing valid measurements but gracefully falling back to default or previous states when measurements are unavailable or unreliable.

*   `FC_INI_AIRT_MDLAD_TIGIM` (Function-call output, possibly echoed or passed through)

## Logic Flow

The Simulink diagram for the "Intake gas temperature model at intake manifold" (`AIRT_MDLAD_TIGIM`) follows a structured approach with distinct initialization and operational phases, controlled by function-call triggers.

1.  **Overall Structure:**
    *   The main block `AIRT_MDLAD_TIGIM` encapsulates the entire model. Its "Activation: always" and "Deactivation: never" suggest it's always available, with internal logic dictating the execution of its sub-components.
    *   It contains two primary sub-systems: `INI X.1` (Initialization) and `OPM X.2` (Operational).

2.  **Initialization Phase (`INI X.1`):**
    *   Triggered by control signals like `fc_INI_AIRT_MDLAD_TIGIM` and various `fc_NVM*` signals (Non-Volatile Memory management) and `fc_ES2ERU` (Error Recovery Unit).
    *   **Purpose:** This phase sets up the initial conditions and parameters for the temperature model.
    *   **Logic (as per accompanying text):**
        *   **Reset Initialization (3.11.1.1):** All temperature variables are initialized with the value from the input `TIG_IM_MDL_INP`. This ensures a known starting point after a reset.
        *   **NVM Data Handling (3.11.1.2):** For a new ECU, `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV` is initialized to 20°C and `RATE_HEAT_IM` is set to its maximum value. This indicates persistent storage handling for certain parameters.
    *   **Data Flow:** The `INI X.1` block receives control signals and potentially feedback from `OPM X.2`. Its outputs are fed into `OPM X.2`, establishing the initial state for the operational calculations.

3.  **Operational Phase (`OPM X.2`):**
    *   Triggered by the `FC_OPM_AIRT_MDLAD_TIGIM` function-call signal.
    *   **Purpose:** This block continuously calculates the intake manifold gas temperature and related states based on the current system conditions and initialized parameters.
    *   **Data Flow:**
        *   It receives a multitude of real-time sensor inputs and model parameters (e.g., `LV_ES`, `M_GAS_TIG_IM_AIRT`, engine speed `<N>`, ambient temperature `<TAA>`, `TEMP_COLD_SRC`, `TEMP_HOT_SRC`) from the left-hand side.
        *   It also receives the initialized states and parameters from `INI X.1`.
        *   It then processes these inputs to calculate the various output signals, including the core `TIG_IM` (Intake Gas Temperature) and associated rates (`RATE_HEAT_IM`), states (`STATE_HEAT_IM`), and status (`TIG_IM_ST`).
    *   **Feedback:** There's a `feedback` signal path from `OPM X.2` back to `INI X.1`, suggesting that the current operational state or certain calculated values might be used by the initialization block for subsequent initializations or consistency checks.

4.  **Specific Calculation Example (3.11.1.3):**
    *   The smaller diagram shows `TIG_IM` (the calculated intake temperature) being processed by `TIG_IM_ST V.6.4` which then feeds into an `ini` block. This implies that `TIG_IM_ST` is likely a filtered, status-derived, or initial-value component of `TIG_IM`. This could represent a low-pass filter, a status flag based on temperature thresholds, or an initial value setting for another component.

In essence, the system first ensures a proper setup by initializing critical variables (potentially from NVM), and then continuously monitors engine and environmental conditions to model and output the intake manifold gas temperature, along with various supporting states and parameters for other control modules.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram (Figure 3.11.4) is to **initialize key parameters related to the heat storage and temperature of the engine intake manifold** after an engine-off period. Specifically, it initializes `RATE_HEAT_IM` (the rate of heat storage in the intake manifold) and `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV` (the hot source temperature for the intake manifold model). This initialization process is critical because the intake manifold temperature can fluctuate significantly after engine shutdown (initially increasing, then cooling towards ambient) and these values, stored in EEPROM, need to be updated to reflect the current physical state accurately based on the engine-off time (`T_ES`). The diagram uses conditional logic to determine whether to perform this calculation or to use existing (pass-through) values.

## Inputs
*   **`LV_ES_NOT_AVL_AIRT`**: (Boolean) Flag indicating if Air Intake Regulation Temperature (AIRT) data is currently unavailable.
*   **`LV_T_ES_VLD`**: (Boolean) Flag indicating if the engine-off time (`T_ES`) measurement is valid.
*   **`LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI`**: (Boolean) An input flag indicating if `RATE_HEAT_IM` is currently marked for initialization.
*   **`RATE_HEAT_IM_MIN_DC`**: The current/stored minimum limit for `RATE_HEAT_IM`.
*   **`RATE_HEAT_IM_MAX_DC`**: The current/stored maximum limit for `RATE_HEAT_IM`.
*   **`TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV`**: The current/stored hot source temperature for the intake manifold model.
*   **`TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV`**: The current/stored cold source temperature for the intake manifold model.
*   **`TEMP_HOT_SRC`**: A general hot source temperature, used by the `CLC_INI` function for calculations.
*   **`TEMP_COLD_SRC`**: A general cold source temperature, used by the `CLC_INI` function for calculations.
*   **`T_ES`**: The measured engine-off time.
*   **`TCO_1_STOP`**: A signal indicating a specific engine cooling or stop event.
*   **`TAA`**: An ambient air temperature or similar environmental temperature input.

## Outputs
The diagram outputs a bus labeled `out` (V.6.4) containing the initialized or selected "current" values for the manifold parameters:
*   **`LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI_cur`**: (Boolean) The updated flag indicating the initialization status of `RATE_HEAT_IM`.
*   **`RATE_HEAT_IM_cur`**: The initialized or selected `RATE_HEAT_IM` value.
*   **`RATE_HEAT_IM_MIN_DC_cur`**: The initialized or selected minimum limit for `RATE_HEAT_IM`.
*   **`RATE_HEAT_IM_MAX_DC_cur`**: The initialized or selected maximum limit for `RATE_HEAT_IM`.
*   **`TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV_cur`**: The initialized or selected hot source temperature for the intake manifold model.
*   **`TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV_cur`**: The initialized or selected cold source temperature for the intake manifold model.

## Logic Flow
1.  **Initial Condition Check (AIRT Availability):**
    *   The process begins by evaluating the `LV_ES_NOT_AVL_AIRT` flag using an `if` block (V.6.3).
    *   **If `LV_ES_NOT_AVL_AIRT` is true:** This signifies that critical Air Intake Regulation Temperature data is unavailable. In this scenario, a "no initialization" decision is made (represented by a selection signal of '1'). The system will bypass the initialization calculation and typically use existing or default values.
    *   **If `LV_ES_NOT_AVL_AIRT` is false:** AIRT data is available, and the logic proceeds to the next step to determine if initialization is required based on other factors.

2.  **Further Initialization Condition Check (Initialization Flag and Engine-Off Time):**
    *   In the `else` branch of the first `if` block, a second conditional evaluation takes place: `NOT(LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI) AND LV_T_ES_VLD`.
    *   **If `NOT(LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI) AND LV_T_ES_VLD` is true:** This composite condition implies that `RATE_HEAT_IM` is currently *not* initialized (`LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI` is false), and the engine-off time (`T_ES`) is valid. This combination triggers the "perform initialization" decision (represented by a selection signal of '2').
    *   **If `NOT(LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI) AND LV_T_ES_VLD` is false:** This occurs if either `RATE_HEAT_IM` is already considered initialized (`LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI` is true) or the `T_ES` is invalid. In this case, a "no initialization" decision is made (selection signal '1').

3.  **Initialization Calculation (CLC_INI Function):**
    *   A function block labeled `fc()` or `CLC_INI` (V.2.1.1.1) takes several inputs: the initial `LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI` flag, `TEMP_HOT_SRC`, `TEMP_COLD_SRC`, `T_ES`, `TCO_1_STOP`, and `TAA`.
    *   This `CLC_INI` function is responsible for performing the complex calculations to determine the initialized values for `LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI_cur`, `RATE_HEAT_IM_cur`, `RATE_HEAT_IM_MIN_DC_cur`, `RATE_HEAT_IM_MAX_DC_cur`, `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV_cur`, and `TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV_cur`. These calculations model the intake manifold temperature behavior during engine-off.

4.  **Value Selection (Implicit Multiport Switches):**
    *   The decision signals (1 or 2) from the conditional logic blocks control a series of implicit `Multiport Switch` blocks (indicated by the connections routing through V.6.3 and V.6.4).
    *   **If the selection signal is '1' (no initialization):** The input values that bypass `CLC_INI` (e.g., `LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI`, `RATE_HEAT_IM_MIN_DC`, etc.) are chosen and routed as the "current" outputs.
    *   **If the selection signal is '2' (perform initialization):** The newly calculated output values from the `CLC_INI` function are chosen and routed as the "current" outputs.

5.  **Output Bus Assembly:**
    *   Finally, all the selected "current" output values (whether passed-through or initialized) are gathered by a `BusMerge` block (V.6.4) and organized into a single output bus named `out`, providing the updated state of the intake manifold parameters.

This image contains two Simulink diagrams, Figure 3.11.5 and Figure 3.11.6, along with descriptive text. These diagrams collectively contribute to an "Intake gas temperature model at intake manifold" (AIRT).

## Function

The primary function of these interconnected Simulink diagrams is to model and calculate key thermal parameters related to an automotive intake manifold. This includes:
1.  **Filtering** raw cold and hot source temperatures to obtain smoothed moving mean values.
2.  **Calculating a warm-up factor** based on these filtered temperatures.
3.  **Determining a current intake manifold heat rate** (`RATE_HEAT_IM_cur`), along with its minimum and maximum duty cycle values, incorporating initialization and limiting logic.
4.  **Providing an initialization status flag** for the heat rate calculations.

## Inputs

The system takes various sensor readings, calibration values, and status signals as inputs:

*   **Raw Temperatures:**
    *   `TEMP_COLD_SRC`: Raw cold source temperature.
    *   `TEMP_HOT_SRC`: Raw hot source temperature.
*   **Previous/Current Filtered Temperatures (for recursive filtering):**
    *   `TEMP_COLD_SRC_cur`: Previous filtered cold source temperature (feedback to filter).
    *   `TEMP_HOT_SRC_cur`: Previous filtered hot source temperature (feedback to filter).
*   **Calibration Parameters:**
    *   `C_CRLC_TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV`: Calibration constant for the cold source moving mean filter (Figure 3.11.6).
    *   `C_CRLC_TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV`: Calibration constant for the hot source moving mean filter (Figure 3.11.6).
    *   `IP_FAC_TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV_INI`: Initialization/fading factor for hot source moving mean (Figure 3.11.5).
    *   `IP_FAC_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI`: Initialization/fading factor for heat rate calculations (Figure 3.11.5).
    *   `phys_min`: Physical minimum limit for the heat rate (Figure 3.11.5, input to V.6.11).
    *   `phys_max`: Physical maximum limit for the heat rate (Figure 3.11.5, input to V.6.11).
*   **Status/Control Signals:**
    *   `RT_RFS`: A reference or run-time feedback status signal (Figure 3.11.5).
    *   `STO_T_STOP_VAA`: A stop status or control signal (Figure 3.11.5).

## Outputs

The system produces the following calculated and status variables:

*   **Filtered Moving Mean Temperatures:**
    *   `TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV`: Filtered cold source temperature moving mean (from Figure 3.11.6).
    *   `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV`: Filtered hot source temperature moving mean (from Figure 3.11.6).
    *   `TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV_cur`: Current cold source temperature moving mean (Figure 3.11.5, direct pass-through of `TEMP_COLD_SRC`).
    *   `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV_cur`: Current hot source temperature moving mean (Figure 3.11.5).
*   **Warm-up Factor:**
    *   `FAC_WUP_TIG_IM_MDL`: Intake gas temperature warm-up factor (Figure 3.11.6).
*   **Intake Manifold Heat Rate and Limits:**
    *   `RATE_HEAT_IM_cur`: Current calculated intake manifold heat rate (Figure 3.11.5).
    *   `RATE_HEAT_IM_MIN_DC_cur`: Current minimum duty cycle for the heat rate (Figure 3.11.5).
    *   `RATE_HEAT_IM_MAX_DC_cur`: Current maximum duty cycle for the heat rate (Figure 3.11.5).
*   **Initialization Status:**
    *   `LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI`: Logical variable indicating the initialization status of the heat rate (Figure 3.11.5).

## Logic Flow

The logical flow integrates the two diagrams as follows:

1.  **Source Temperature Filtering (Figure 3.11.6):**
    *   Raw `TEMP_COLD_SRC` is filtered along with its previous value `TEMP_COLD_SRC_cur` using a calibrated filter (V.7.5, calibrated by `C_CRLC_TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV`). This produces `TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV`.
    *   Similarly, raw `TEMP_HOT_SRC` is filtered with `TEMP_HOT_SRC_cur` using `C_CRLC_TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV` to yield `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV`. These filter blocks likely implement a recursive moving average or exponential smoothing.
    *   The resulting `TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV` and `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV` are output.

2.  **Warm-up Factor Calculation (Figure 3.11.6):**
    *   The filtered temperatures `TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV` (`x_val`) and `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV` (`y_val`) are used as inputs to a 2D lookup table (V.7.7) labeled `IP_FAC_WUP_TIG_IM_MDL`.
    *   This lookup table determines `FAC_WUP_TIG_IM_MDL` based on the combination of these two temperatures, representing a warm-up characteristic.

3.  **Hot Source MMV Current Value (Figure 3.11.5):**
    *   The `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV` (output from Figure 3.11.6) and the raw `TEMP_HOT_SRC` are fed into a fading block (V.7.10), which applies a weighted average using `IP_FAC_TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV_INI` as the blending factor. This result is named `up_val`.
    *   A switch, controlled by `RT_RFS`, selects between `up_val` and `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV` (the input to this diagram's fading block). The selected value becomes `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV_cur`.

4.  **Rate Heat IM Calculation and Limiting (Figure 3.11.5):**
    *   The `STO_T_STOP_VAA` signal is processed by a 1D lookup table (V.7.7) named `IP_FAC_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI` to produce a factor `y_val`.
    *   This `y_val` is then compared or limited against a value of `1` using a "greater than or equal to" block (V.6.5), ensuring a specific range for the subsequent calculation.
    *   The output of this comparison (or the `y_val` itself if less than 1) then enters a subsystem (V.6.11) that also receives physical limits (`phys_min`, `phys_max`). This subsystem calculates an intermediate `RATE_HEAT_IM`, `RATE_HEAT_IM_MIN_DC`, and `RATE_HEAT_IM_MAX_DC` by applying these limits.
    *   `RATE_HEAT_IM` is then blended with a constant `1` using another fading block (V.7.10) with `IP_FAC_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI` as the factor. The output is `RATE_HEAT_IM_cur`.
    *   Similarly, `RATE_HEAT_IM_MIN_DC` and `RATE_HEAT_IM_MAX_DC` are blended with `1` using the same `IP_FAC_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI` factor to produce `RATE_HEAT_IM_MIN_DC_cur` and `RATE_HEAT_IM_MAX_DC_cur`, respectively.

5.  **Heat Rate Initialization Flag (Figure 3.11.5):**
    *   A constant value of `1` (V.6.8) is directly output as `LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI`. This signal likely acts as an enable flag for downstream calculations, indicating that the system is considered initialized. The accompanying text explicitly states that related calculations are performed "only with LV_RATE_HEAT_IM_INI = 1".

6.  **Cold Source MMV Pass-through (Figure 3.11.5):**
    *   The `TEMP_COLD_SRC` input is directly passed through as `TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV_cur` without any further processing shown in this specific diagram.

This is a Simulink diagram representing a model for calculating intake gas temperature.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to **model and calculate the intake gas temperature at the intake manifold**. It incorporates an offset calculation based on engine and vehicle operating conditions, and applies this offset conditionally to a core temperature calculation module. The model is dynamic, using feedback of calculated temperatures.

## Inputs
The key inputs to this overall system are:
*   **NC_TIG_IM_CONF**: A configuration parameter that determines how the calculated temperature offset is applied to the main temperature model.
*   **M_GAS_TIG_IM_AIRT**: Intake air mass flow rate.
*   **N**: Engine speed.
*   **VS**: A vehicle state or speed-related parameter.
*   **LV_ES**: Engine status, likely indicating if the engine is stopped or running.
*   **RATE_HEAT_IM**: The rate of heat transfer in the intake manifold.
*   **FAC_WUP_TIG_IM_MDL**: A factor accounting for the influence of warm-up on the intake gas temperature model.
*   **LV_TIG_MDL_FIL_SWI**: A switch or flag for controlling filtering within the intake gas temperature model.
*   **T_AST**: Ambient or atmospheric temperature.
*   **TIG_IM**: The previously calculated intake manifold gas temperature (feedback for dynamic modeling).
*   **TIG_IM_FIL_TMP**: The previously calculated filtered intake manifold gas temperature (feedback for dynamic modeling).

## Outputs
The system produces a single bus output named `out`, which contains the following individual signals:
*   **TIG_IM_MDL_OFS**: The calculated intake manifold temperature offset.
*   **TIG_IM**: The currently calculated intake manifold gas temperature.
*   **CRLC_TIG_IM_MDL**: A corrected or calibrated intake manifold gas temperature model output.
*   **TIG_IM_FIL_TMP**: The currently calculated filtered intake manifold gas temperature.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow can be broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Intake Gas Temperature Offset Calculation (`CLC_TIG_IM_OFS`):**
    *   This subsystem first calculates a temperature offset, `TIG_IM_MDL_OFS`.
    *   It uses two 2D lookup tables:
        *   `IP_TIG_IM_MDL_OFS_1` takes `N` (engine speed) and `M_GAS_TIG_IM_AIRT` (air mass flow) as inputs to determine a partial offset value.
        *   `IP_TIG_IM_MDL_OFS_2` takes `VS` (vehicle state) and `RATE_HEAT_IM` (heat rate) as inputs to determine another partial offset value.
    *   These two partial offset values are summed together.
    *   The sum is then scaled by multiplying it with `FAC_WUP_TIG_IM_MDL` (warm-up factor).
    *   Finally, a conditional check is performed using `LV_ES` (engine status): If `LV_ES` is `0` (implying engine stop), the `TIG_IM_MDL_OFS` is forced to `0`. Otherwise, the scaled sum is output as `TIG_IM_MDL_OFS`. This ensures no offset is applied when the engine is not running.

2.  **Conditional Offset Application:**
    *   The output `TIG_IM_MDL_OFS` is then used in a conditional logic path controlled by `NC_TIG_IM_CONF`.
    *   A switch block (controlled by `NC_TIG_IM_CONF > 0`) determines the value of `TIG_IM_MDL_INP`, which is an input to the main temperature calculation module (`CLC_TIG_IM`).
    *   **If `NC_TIG_IM_CONF > 0` (True path):** The `TIG_IM_MDL_OFS` is passed directly as `TIG_IM_MDL_INP`.
    *   **If `NC_TIG_IM_CONF <= 0` (False path):** The `TIG_IM_MDL_OFS` is subtracted from the *current* `TIG_IM` (feedback from the main calculation) before being passed as `TIG_IM_MDL_INP`. This indicates a dynamic adjustment based on the current temperature.

3.  **Main Intake Gas Temperature Calculation (`CLC_TIG_IM`):**
    *   This subsystem performs the core modeling of the intake gas temperature.
    *   It takes `TIG_IM_MDL_INP` (the conditionally adjusted offset/temperature input) as a primary input.
    *   Other inputs affecting this calculation include `LV_ES` (engine status), `LV_TIG_MDL_FIL_SWI` (filter switch), `T_AST` (ambient temperature), and the feedback signals `TIG_IM` and `TIG_IM_FIL_TMP`.
    *   It outputs the newly calculated `TIG_IM` (intake manifold gas temperature), `CRLC_TIG_IM_MDL` (a corrected/calibrated model output), and `TIG_IM_FIL_TMP` (filtered intake manifold gas temperature).

4.  **Feedback and Output Merging:**
    *   The newly calculated `TIG_IM` and `TIG_IM_FIL_TMP` are fed back to the `CLC_TIG_IM` subsystem, indicating a continuous, iterative, or dynamic modeling approach where the previous state influences the current calculation.
    *   Finally, all relevant calculated values (`TIG_IM_MDL_OFS`, `TIG_IM`, `CRLC_TIG_IM_MDL`, `TIG_IM_FIL_TMP`) are combined into a single bus labeled `out`, which represents the overall output of the intake gas temperature model.


--- Page 87 ---

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to model and estimate the **Intake Gas Temperature at the Intake Valve (AIRT)**. It likely represents a component within an engine control unit (ECU) responsible for providing an accurate intake temperature signal for various engine control strategies. The model incorporates distinct initialization procedures for different operating conditions (e.g., reset, ES2ERU, DCON) and a continuous operational calculation.

## Inputs

*   `<TIG_INV_MDL_INP>`: Intake gas temperature model input (used for initialization).

## Outputs
The primary outputs of the system are:

*   `<TIG_INV>`: The estimated Intake Gas Temperature at the Intake Valve (main output).
*   `<TIG_INV_ST>`: A status variable related to the intake gas temperature model.
*   `<TIG_INV_ST_DC>`: A status variable related to the intake gas temperature model specifically for deceleration conditions.

Internal/Intermediate outputs from the `OPM` block, which contribute to the final outputs or model internal states, include:
*   `CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL`
*   `CTR_TIG_INV_MDL_RAMP`
*   `IDX_CAM_EX_TIG_INV_VLFT`
*   `IDX_CAM_IN_TIG_INV_VLFT`
*   `TIG_INV_O_V`
*   `TIG_INV_FIL`
*   `TIG_INV_MDL_OFS`
*   `TIG_INV_MDL_BAS`
*   `TIG_INV_ST_DC_O_V`

## Logic Flow

The system operates as a state-based model with an initialization phase and a continuous operational phase, potentially controlled by a scheduler or state machine.

1.  **Overall System Activation:** The main subsystem (indicated by the orange block on the left) is configured to be `Activation: always`, meaning its logic is continuously evaluated. However, its internal blocks (`INI` and `OPM`) are likely conditionally executed based on control signals.

2.  **Input Gathering:** All the listed input signals, representing various engine parameters, environmental conditions, and model configurations, are fed into the main subsystem.

3.  **Mode Selection (Initialization vs. Operation):**
    *   The control signals `FC_INI_AIRT_MDLAD_TIGINV` and `FC_OPM_AIRT_MDLAD_TIGINV` govern whether the `INI` (Initialization) block (X.1) or the `OPM` (Operational Model) block (X.2) is active or dominant in setting the output values.
    *   The `INI` block also receives specific flags like `<fc_ES2ERU>` and `<fc_DCON>` which are crucial for specific initialization scenarios.

4.  **Initialization Phase (INI Block - X.1):**
    *   This block is responsible for setting the initial values of temperature variables. The accompanying text states: "All temperature variables are initialized with TIG_INV_MDL_INP". This implies that during a system reset or specific startup phases, `TIG_INV_MDL_INP` is used as a baseline for the temperature estimation.
    *   The `INI` block takes various inputs, including initialization triggers and feedback, to ensure a stable and correct starting point for the model.

5.  **Operational Phase (OPM Block - X.2):**
    *   Once initialized, the `OPM` block continuously calculates the intake gas temperature (`TIG_INV`) during normal engine operation.
    *   It receives a set of `input` signals (likely processed versions of the direct inputs or specific parameters relevant for continuous calculation) and a `<feedback>` signal.
    *   The `OPM` block performs complex calculations, potentially involving filtering, ramp functions, and offsets, to derive the current intake gas temperature and related status variables. It outputs `TIG_INV`, `TIG_INV_ST`, and `TIG_INV_ST_DC`, along with several internal intermediate signals.

6.  **Feedback Loop:** A `<feedback>` signal is shown looping from the main subsystem output back into both the `INI` and `OPM` blocks. This indicates that the current or previous calculated values of `TIG_INV` or related states are used in subsequent calculations, forming a dynamic model that adapts over time.

7.  **Specific Calculation Contexts (Figures 3.12.2 and 3.12.3):**
    *   **Calculation at ES2ERU (Figure 3.12.2):** During the "Engine Start 2nd Run Up" phase, the `TIG_INV` value (the primary temperature output) is processed through a block (labeled V.6.4) to generate `TIG_INV_ST`. This `TIG_INV_ST` signal then feeds into an `ini` block, implying it's used to initialize or update an internal state variable for subsequent calculations under this condition.
    *   **Calculation at DCON (Figure 3.12.3):** Similarly, during a "Deceleration ON" state, the `TIG_INV_ST` value is processed through another block (V.6.4) to generate `TIG_INV_ST_DC`. This `TIG_INV_ST_DC` also feeds into an `ini` block, indicating its use for initializing or updating another specific state variable relevant for deceleration conditions.

In summary, the system dynamically estimates intake gas temperature by switching between initialization routines (dependent on reset, startup, or specific engine states) and a continuous operational model, with internal feedback loops ensuring accurate and responsive temperature tracking.

This Simulink diagram, "Figure 3.12.4", depicts a system for calculating a temperature offset value within an intake gas temperature model.

## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to calculate the **Intake Gas Temperature Model Offset Base (`TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_BAS`)**. This offset value is dynamically determined based on system configuration, variable valve lift conditions, engine operating parameters (like speed/heat rate), and a warm-up factor, with an explicit override to zero when the engine is stopped. The calculation path for the valve lift indices (`IDX_CAM_IN_TIG_INV_VLFT`, `IDX_CAM_EX_TIG_INV_VLFT`) is also determined as an intermediate step.

## Inputs

*   **`NC_TIG_INV_CONF`**: A configuration parameter that determines which intake gas temperature model (or parts of it) should be calculated. Values 0-3 correspond to different calculation modes (e.g., model not calculated, VVTI model calculated, VVTI & VVLI model calculated).
*   **`LV_VLFT_SWI_DIR`**: A flag indicating the variable valve lift (VVLFT) switch direction, used to select between different VVLFT calculation sub-models.
*   **`M_GAS_TIG_INV_AIRT`**: Mass of gas from the intake air temperature model.
*   **`CAM_PHA_ENG`**: Engine camshaft phase.
*   **`NC_IDX_IN`**: Index for intake (specific purpose not fully detailed, likely a configuration or lookup index).
*   **`NC_IDX_EX`**: Index for exhaust (specific purpose not fully detailed, likely a configuration or lookup index).
*   **`<VS>`**: An input for the 2D lookup table (likely representing vehicle speed or engine speed for mapping).
*   **`<RATE_HEAT_IM>`**: An input for the 2D lookup table (likely representing the rate of heat input to the intake manifold).
*   **`FAC_WUP_TIG_IM_MDL`**: A factor for the warm-up phase of the intake manifold model.
*   **`_LV_ES_`**: An engine stop flag.

## Outputs

*   **`IDX_CAM_IN_TIG_INV_VLFT`**: Intake camshaft index derived from the intake variable valve lift calculation.
*   **`IDX_CAM_EX_TIG_INV_VLFT`**: Exhaust camshaft index derived from the intake variable valve lift calculation.
*   **`TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_BAS`**: The calculated base offset value for the intake gas temperature model.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow can be broken down into the following steps:

1.  **System Configuration-based Path Selection:**
    *   The process begins with an `If-Else` block that checks the `NC_TIG_INV_CONF` input.
    *   If `NC_TIG_INV_CONF` meets a specific condition (likely `== 3` as per the diagram's `[if]` label and accompanying text, implying a full VVTI & VVLI model calculation), a path for this condition (not fully visible in the diagram) is activated.
    *   If `NC_TIG_INV_CONF` does *not* meet this condition (the `[else]` path), the logic shown in the diagram proceeds. This `else` path covers scenarios where the model is not calculated, or only parts of it (e.g., VVTI only) are calculated.

2.  **Variable Valve Lift (VVLFT) Model Selection:**
    *   Within the `else` path of the `NC_TIG_INV_CONF` check, another `If-Else` block is used to select between different VVLFT calculation methods based on `LV_VLFT_SWI_DIR`.
    *   **If `LV_VLFT_SWI_DIR` is true (conditional `cond_if`):** The `IP_TIG_INV_VLFT_1` subsystem/function is activated. It takes `M_GAS_TIG_INV_AIRT`, `CAM_PHA_ENG`, `NC_IDX_IN`, and `NC_IDX_EX` as inputs. Its outputs are then passed through `Merge` blocks to become `IDX_CAM_IN_TIG_INV_VLFT` and `IDX_CAM_EX_TIG_INV_VLFT`.
    *   **If `LV_VLFT_SWI_DIR` is false (conditional `else`):** The `IP_TIG_INV_VLFT_STND` subsystem/function is activated. It takes the same set of inputs (`M_GAS_TIG_INV_AIRT`, `CAM_PHA_ENG`, `NC_IDX_IN`, `NC_IDX_EX`). Its outputs are also passed through `Merge` blocks to become `IDX_CAM_IN_TIG_INV_VLFT` and `IDX_CAM_EX_TIG_INV_VLFT`.
    *   These `Merge` blocks ensure that the appropriate calculated valve lift index values are propagated as outputs, and `IDX_CAM_EX_TIG_INV_VLFT` is also used for the subsequent offset calculation.

3.  **Intermediate Offset Calculation:**
    *   The `IDX_CAM_EX_TIG_INV_VLFT` signal (from the merge block) is fed as one input to an `Add` block (`V.7.5`).
    *   The second input to the `Add` block comes from a 2D lookup table, `IP_TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_2`. This lookup table takes `<VS>` (x-axis) and `<RATE_HEAT_IM>` (y-axis) as its inputs and produces an offset value.
    *   The sum from the `Add` block (`V.7.5`) is then multiplied by `FAC_WUP_TIG_IM_MDL` using a `Product` block (`V.7.6`). This result represents an intermediate, unconditioned offset value.

4.  **Engine Stop Override:**
    *   The intermediate offset value from `V.7.6` is fed into a `Switch` block (`V.6.8`).
    *   The `_LV_ES_` (Engine Stop) flag controls this switch. The condition "Check ~> 0" implies that if `_LV_ES_` is active (e.g., true, non-zero), the switch's lower input (which is hardcoded `0`) is selected.
    *   If `_LV_ES_` is inactive (e.g., false, zero), the switch's upper input (the intermediate offset value) is selected.
    *   This step ensures that the `TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_BAS` is set to `0` when the engine is stopped, as specified in the problem description.

5.  **Final Output:**
    *   The output of the `Switch` block (`V.6.8`) is the final `TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_BAS`, representing the base offset for the intake gas temperature model.

This image displays a Simulink-like block diagram.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is the **"Calculation of intake gas temperature at intake valve"**, as stated in the title "AIRT. Intake gas temperature model at intake valve" and the accompanying section header "3.12.2.3 Calculation of intake gas temperature at intake valve". Specifically, it implements a filter algorithm to determine a ramp and an offset for the intake gas temperature model, adapting its behavior based on various conditions like valvelift changes, engine start, and running states. It aims to provide smoothed and conditionally adjusted temperature values.

## Inputs
The key inputs to this system are represented by the green blocks:
*   `<LV_VLFT_SWI_DIR>`: Valvelift switch direction.
*   `<LV_VLFT_SWI_DIR_tmp>`: Temporary or unacknowledged valvelift switch direction (also an output, implying a state variable).
*   `<CTR_TIG_INV_MDL_RAMP>`: Current value of the intake gas temperature model ramp (also an output, implying a state variable).
*   `<TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_BAS>`: Base value for the intake gas temperature model offset.
*   `<TIG_INV_MDL_OFS>`: Current value of the intake gas temperature model offset.

## Outputs
The key outputs from this system are represented by the blue blocks:
*   `<LV_VLFT_SWI_DIR_tmp>`: The processed/updated temporary valvelift switch direction.
*   `<CTR_TIG_INV_MDL_RAMP>`: The calculated and filtered ramp value for the intake gas temperature model.
*   `<TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_tmp>`: The calculated and filtered offset temporary value for the intake gas temperature model.

## Logic Flow
The diagram's logic can be broken down into three main processing paths:

1.  **Valvelift Switch Direction Processing (Top Section):**
    *   The current valvelift switch direction (`<LV_VLFT_SWI_DIR>`) and a temporary/previous state (`<LV_VLFT_SWI_DIR_tmp>`) are fed into a custom block (V.6.7). This block likely processes or evaluates the valvelift status.
    *   The output `y` from V.6.7 then enters a conditional block (`cond_if V.6.3`).
    *   **Condition:** If "change of valvelift acknowledged", the output is sourced from an `f()` block (a function call, potentially to retrieve a specific value or implement logic).
    *   **Else (Condition):** If "no change of valvelift", a different path is taken, implying a direct pass-through or a default value.
    *   A Merge block (V.6.4) selects the appropriate value based on the condition.
    *   The output of the Merge block updates the `<LV_VLFT_SWI_DIR_tmp>` variable.

2.  **Ramp Calculation and Filtering (Middle Section):**
    *   The existing ramp value (`<CTR_TIG_INV_MDL_RAMP>`) is summed with a constant `1` (V.6.8), indicating an incrementing action.
    *   This incremented value passes through a filter/integrator block (V.7.5).
    *   The output of this filter/integrator is then processed by a `max` block (V.6.10) with `0`, ensuring the ramp value does not fall below zero.
    *   This non-negative value then passes through another filter/integrator block (V.7.5), providing further smoothing or accumulation.
    *   A conditional block (`cond_if V.6.3`) determines the final ramp output:
        *   One branch passes the output of the second V.7.5 block (the filtered, accumulated ramp).
        *   The other branch provides a direct input labeled "C_CTR_TIG_INV_MDL_RAMP", likely a predefined constant ramp value used under specific conditions (e.g., during engine start, as per the descriptive text).
    *   A Merge block (V.6.4) selects between these two ramp paths.
    *   The final selected value updates the `<CTR_TIG_INV_MDL_RAMP>` variable, representing the calculated and filtered intake gas temperature model ramp.

3.  **Offset Calculation and Filtering (Bottom Section):**
    *   The base offset value (`<TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_BAS>`) and the current offset (`<TIG_INV_MDL_OFS>`) are summed.
    *   This sum passes through a filter/integrator block (V.7.5).
    *   The output of this V.7.5 block is then summed with another input (potentially a feedback of the filtered offset, creating a closed-loop filtering structure) and passed through a second filter/integrator block (V.7.5). This two-stage filtering likely provides robust smoothing of the offset.
    *   A conditional block (`cond_if V.6.3`) determines the final offset output based on a "ramping" condition:
        *   **Condition:** If "ramping", the output of the second V.7.5 block (the filtered offset) is selected.
        *   **Else (Condition):** If "no ramping", a constant `0` (V.6.8) is selected. This aligns with the text stating "the offset starts with the value 0".
    *   A Merge block (V.6.2) selects between these two offset paths.
    *   The final selected value updates the `<TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_tmp>` variable, representing the calculated and conditionally filtered offset for the intake gas temperature model.

This image is a Simulink diagram, specifically showing an intake gas temperature model.

## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to calculate and filter the intake gas temperature at the intake valve (`TIG_INV`). It provides two main outputs: a dynamically modeled and limited intake gas temperature (`CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL`) and a final filtered intake gas temperature (`TIG_INV`). The model incorporates dynamic smoothing, limiting, and filtering logic, with various enable and bypass switches to control its behavior.

## Inputs

1.  **`C_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL_AST`**: Calibration parameter for the aspiration temperature model, likely an upper limit.
2.  **`C_T_AST_MAX_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL`**: Calibration parameter for the maximum aspiration temperature model, likely a lower limit for the processed value.
3.  **`_TIG_INV_INP_`**: The primary input signal representing the raw or estimated intake gas temperature at the intake valve.
4.  **`_TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_`**: An offset value applied to the raw intake gas temperature input.
5.  **`C_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL_ES`**: Enable/switch signal for the intake gas temperature model path, controlling whether the dynamic model or a bypass value is used.
6.  **`IP_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL`**: An "Initial Point" or "Intermediate Point" value, possibly a raw or reference temperature used in both model calculation and filtering paths, and for bypass conditions.
7.  **`C_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL_FIL_SWI`**: Switch signal to enable/disable or control the input to the PT1 filter in the lower path.
8.  **`C_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL_TFIL`**: Time constant or coefficient for the PT1 (first-order lag) filter.
9.  **`C_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL_TMP`**: Calibration or temporary parameter, likely controlling a final selection switch in the filtering path.

## Outputs

1.  **`<CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL>`**: The calculated intake gas temperature model output, which has undergone dynamic smoothing and limiting.
2.  **`<TIG_INV>`**: The final, filtered intake gas temperature at the intake valve.
3.  **`<TIG_INV_FIL_TMP>`**: A temporary filtered output or an intermediate value from the PT1 filter, potentially used for diagnostics or as a feedback signal.

## Logic Flow

The diagram processes signals through two main parallel paths: one for a dynamically modeled temperature and another for a filtered measured/estimated temperature.

### Path 1: Intake Gas Temperature Model Calculation (`<CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL>`)

1.  **Initial Point Processing:** The `IP_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL` signal is passed through a data type conversion block (V.7.5). This signal serves as the input `F` for the subsequent `FADING` block.
2.  **Dynamic Smoothing (FADING):** A `FADING` block (V.7.10) applies a dynamic smoothing or blending function (likely `y = A*(1-F) + B*F`) to the `IP_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL` signal. Parameters `A` and `B` are internal or implicitly provided.
3.  **Upper Limit Application:** The output `y` from the `FADING` block is fed into a `MIN` block (V.7.5) along with `C_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL_AST`. This ensures the processed temperature does not exceed the aspiration temperature upper limit.
4.  **Lower Limit Application:** The output `y` from the `FADING` block is also fed into a `MAX` block (V.7.5) along with `C_T_AST_MAX_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL`. This ensures the processed temperature does not fall below the maximum aspiration temperature (effectively a lower bound).
5.  **Intermediate Model Logic (V.6.5):** The outputs from the `MIN` block, the `MAX` block, and the original `IP_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL` signal are fed into a custom block labeled V.6.5. This block likely consolidates these three inputs into a single intermediate model value, possibly applying further logic or limiting. (The '<' symbol indicates it might involve a relational operation internally or is a specific type of limiting block).
6.  **Model Enable/Bypass Switch:** A `Switch` block (V.6.9, with "Check ~ 0" logic) selects its output. If the control signal `C_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL_ES` is active (non-zero), it outputs the result from the V.6.5 block. Otherwise, it outputs the original `IP_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL` directly, bypassing the dynamic smoothing and limiting logic.
7.  **Output Model:** The final output of this switch is the dynamically modeled and limited intake gas temperature, `<CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL>`.

### Path 2: Filtered Intake Gas Temperature Output (`<TIG_INV>`)

1.  **Input and Offset Summation:** The primary intake temperature input `_TIG_INV_INP_` is added to an offset value `_TIG_INV_MDL_OFS_` in an `ADD` block (V.7.5) to produce an intermediate sum labeled `x_val`.
2.  **Filter Input Selection:** A `Switch` block (V.6.9) selects the input to the first-order lag filter. If the control signal `C_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL_FIL_SWI` is active, it uses `x_val` (the sum of input and offset). Otherwise, it uses `IP_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL` as the filter input.
3.  **First-Order Lag (PT1) Filter:** The selected signal (`u`) is then fed into a `PT1` filter block (V.7.5, denoted by 'm' with a curved line). This block applies a first-order lag (smoothing) to the input signal. The filter's time constant or coefficient is `C_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL_TFIL` (`m`). The output of this filter is labeled `x_out`. The `x_in` input represents the previous state of the filter, providing feedback for its discrete operation.
4.  **Filtered Temporary Output:** The `x_out` value from the `PT1` filter is directly output as `<TIG_INV_FIL_TMP>`. This provides access to the raw filtered value before the final selection.
5.  **Final Filtered Output Selection:** A second `Switch` block (V.6.9) determines the ultimate filtered output. If the control signal `C_CRLC_TIG_INV_MDL_TMP` is active, it passes `x_out` (the current PT1 filter output). Otherwise, it passes the value from `<TIG_INV_FIL_TMP>` (which is `x_out` but implies a potential selection based on a previous state or a specific bypass condition).
6.  **Final Filtered Output:** The output of this final switch is the filtered intake gas temperature, `<TIG_INV>`.

This is a Simulink diagram representing a model for calculating intake gas temperature at the throttle.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to model and calculate the intake gas temperature at the throttle (`TIG_THR`), taking into account various engine operating conditions, environmental factors, and thermal influences. It specifically includes the calculation of a temperature offset and a warm-up factor, which are then used to refine the final temperature estimation, potentially incorporating filtering and dynamic behavior.

## Inputs
The key inputs to this system are:

*   **NC_TIG_THR_CONF**: Configuration parameter for the intake gas temperature model at the throttle, potentially enabling/disabling certain features or setting modes.
*   **M_GAS_TIG_THR_AIRF**: Measured or estimated air mass flow at the throttle.
*   **N**: Engine speed.
*   **VS**: Vehicle speed.
*   **RATE_HEAT_IM**: Rate of heat input or transfer within the intake manifold.
*   **TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV**: Temperature of a cold thermal source, likely related to coolant or ambient air.
*   **TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV**: Temperature of a hot thermal source, likely related to engine block or exhaust components.
*   **LV_ES**: Engine status (e.g., running, stopped, start-up), influencing the model's behavior.
*   **T_AST**: Ambient air temperature.
*   **LV_TIG_MDL_FIL_SWI**: A logical switch to enable or disable filtering within the temperature model.
*   **TIG_THR_MDL_INP**: An initial or raw input temperature for the throttle intake gas model, possibly a measured value or a baseline.

## Outputs
The key outputs of this system, bundled into a single bus, are:

*   **FAC_WUP_TIG_THR_MDL**: A calculated warm-up factor for the throttle intake gas model, indicating how close the system is to a steady-state thermal condition.
*   **TIG_THR_MDL_OFS**: The calculated temperature offset for the throttle intake gas model.
*   **TIG_THR**: The final, calculated intake gas temperature at the throttle.
*   **CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL**: A calculated, possibly raw or unfiltered, intake gas temperature from the model.
*   **TIG_THR_FIL_TMP**: A filtered temporary value of the intake gas temperature, likely an intermediate state from the filtering process.

## Logic Flow

1.  **Configuration Handling:** The `NC_TIG_THR_CONF` input is processed by a switch block (`#if NC_TIG_THR_CONF > 0`). This allows the system to select between using the provided `NC_TIG_THR_CONF` value or a default value (labeled '1') as an input for the offset calculation. This indicates a configurable aspect of the temperature model.

2.  **Offset and Warm-up Factor Calculation (CLC_TIG_THR_OFS):**
    *   The first major subsystem, labeled `CLC_TIG_THR_OFS` (Calculate Intake Gas Temperature Throttle Offset), takes numerous inputs, including the (potentially switched) `NC_TIG_THR_CONF`, `M_GAS_TIG_THR_AIRF`, `N`, `VS`, `RATE_HEAT_IM`, `TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV`, `TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV`, and `LV_ES`.
    *   This block calculates the `TIG_THR_MDL_OFS` (throttle intake gas temperature model offset) and `FAC_WUP_TIG_THR_MDL` (warm-up factor).
    *   The accompanying text "As the influence of the offset is depending on the air mass flow, the offset will be set to O at engine stop" directly describes logic within this block, implying that the offset calculation is dynamically adjusted based on operating conditions and can be zeroed out when the engine is off.

3.  **Intake Gas Temperature Calculation (CLC_THR):**
    *   The second major subsystem, labeled `CLC_THR` (Calculate Throttle Temperature), takes the calculated `TIG_THR_MDL_OFS` as an input from the `CLC_TIG_THR_OFS` block. This offset is then applied to the temperature calculation.
    *   Additional inputs to this block include `LV_ES`, `LV_TIG_MDL_FIL_SWI`, `T_AST`, and `TIG_THR_MDL_INP`.
    *   Crucially, there are feedback loops for `TIG_THR` and `TIG_THR_FIL_TMP` back into this block. This strongly suggests that `CLC_THR` incorporates dynamic modeling, filtering, or integration to account for thermal inertia and time-dependent temperature changes, making the current output dependent on previous states.
    *   This block produces the main `TIG_THR` output, along with `CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL` and `TIG_THR_FIL_TMP`.

4.  **Output Aggregation:** All five primary output signals from the two calculation blocks (`FAC_WUP_TIG_THR_MDL`, `TIG_THR_MDL_OFS`, `TIG_THR`, `CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL`, `TIG_THR_FIL_TMP`) are combined into a single bus signal using a `BusMerge` block.

5.  **System Output:** This merged bus represents the final output of the entire Simulink model, delivered via an "opm" (output port) block.

The image provided is a Simulink diagram, consisting of two sub-diagrams (Figure 3.13.5 and Figure 3.13.6) that together describe the calculation and filtering of intake gas temperature.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to calculate and adaptively filter the intake gas temperature at the throttle. It integrates various sensor inputs and model parameters related to engine speed, mass gas flow, thermal conditions, and engine start/stop status to provide a robust and smoothed temperature value, which can be used for engine control. The filtering strategy can also be switched to either filter the entire temperature value or only an offset component.

## Inputs
Here is a consolidated list of key inputs identified from both diagrams:

*   **`<N>`**: Engine speed (used for look-up tables).
*   **`<M_GAS_TIG_THR_AIRT>`**: Mass of gas (air) intake temperature at throttle (measurement or model input).
*   **`<VS>`**: Vehicle speed or a related status signal.
*   **`<RATE_HEAT_IM>`**: Rate of heat transfer in the intake manifold.
*   **`<TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV>`**: Temperature from a cold heat source affecting the intake manifold.
*   **`<TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV>`**: Temperature from a hot heat source affecting the intake manifold.
*   **`<T_AST>`**: Engine start status flag (e.g., indicating engine is cranking or recently started).
*   **`<LV_ES>`**: Engine Stop/Run status (Boolean, 0 for stop, 1 for run).
*   **`C_CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL_AST`**: Filtering constant specifically used during engine start.
*   **`C_T_AST_MAX_CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL`**: Maximum allowed filtering constant during engine start.
*   **`<TIG_THR>`**: Raw or current intake gas temperature value (serves as an input for adaptive filtering constant calculation and also as a final output).
*   **`IP_CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL`**: A 2D look-up table representing dynamic filtering constants based on temperature difference.
*   **`<TIG_THR_MDL_INIT>`**: Initial or base value for the intake gas temperature model.
*   **`<LV_TIG_MDL_FIL_SWI>`**: Filter strategy switch (Boolean, decides to filter whole value or just offset).
*   **`C_CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL_ES`**: Filtering constant used when the engine is stopped.

## Outputs
The main outputs of this system are:

*   **`<TIG_THR_MDL_OFS>`**: The calculated offset for the intake gas temperature model at the throttle.
*   **`<FAC_WUP_TIG_THR_MDL>`**: A warm-up factor for the intake gas temperature model.
*   **`<CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL>`**: The dynamically calculated filtering constant for the intake gas temperature model.
*   **`<TIG_THR_FIL_TMP>`**: An intermediate, temporary filtered intake gas temperature value.
*   **`<TIG_THR>`**: The final, adaptively filtered intake gas temperature at the throttle.

## Logic Flow

The system's logic flow proceeds in two main stages, corresponding to the two diagrams:

**Stage 1: Calculation of Offset and Warm-up Factor (Figure 3.13.5)**

1.  **Offset Calculation (`<TIG_THR_MDL_OFS>`):**
    *   Two 2D look-up tables (LUTs), `IP_TIG_THR_MDL_OFS_1` and `IP_TIG_THR_MDL_OFS_2`, take `<N>` (engine speed) as their x-input.
    *   `IP_TIG_THR_MDL_OFS_1` uses `<M_GAS_TIG_THR_AIRT>` as its y-input, while `IP_TIG_THR_MDL_OFS_2` uses `<VS>` (vehicle speed) as its y-input.
    *   The outputs of these two LUTs are summed together.
    *   A switch (V.6.9) then controls this sum: if `<LV_ES>` (Engine Stop/Run status) indicates the engine is stopped (0), the output is forced to 0; otherwise (engine running, 1), the summed value is passed through.
    *   The result is the intake gas temperature model offset, `<TIG_THR_MDL_OFS>`.

2.  **Warm-up Factor Calculation (`<FAC_WUP_TIG_THR_MDL>`):**
    *   A 2D look-up table, `IP_FAC_WUP_TIG_THR_MDL`, is used.
    *   Its x-input is the sum of `<TEMP_COLD_SRC_MMV>` and `<TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV>`.
    *   Its y-input is `<RATE_HEAT_IM>`.
    *   The output of this LUT is the warm-up factor, `<FAC_WUP_TIG_THR_MDL>`.

**Stage 2: Adaptive Filtering of Intake Gas Temperature (Figure 3.13.6)**

1.  **Filtering Constant Calculation (`<CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL>`):**
    *   **Engine Start Filtering:** If `<T_AST>` (engine start flag) is active, a "FADING" (ramping) block (V.7.10) is engaged. It smoothly transitions a value from an initial state towards `C_CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL_AST`. This ramped value is then upper-limited by `C_T_AST_MAX_CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL` using a comparison (V.6.5) and a switch.
    *   **Engine Stop/Run Selection:** A main switch (V.6.9) selects the final filtering constant.
        *   If `<LV_ES>` is 0 (engine stopped), `C_CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL_ES` is chosen.
        *   If `<LV_ES>` is 1 (engine running), the output from the engine start ramping logic (or potentially a value derived from `IP_CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL` based on temperature differences, as described in the accompanying text) is selected.
    *   The chosen value becomes the filtering constant, `<CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL>`.

2.  **Intermediate Filtered Temperature Calculation (`<TIG_THR_FIL_TMP>`):**
    *   An input signal for the filter (`x_in`) is determined by the `LV_TIG_MDL_FIL_SWI` switch:
        *   If `LV_TIG_MDL_FIL_SWI` is 1 (filter the "whole value"), `x_in` is the sum of `<TIG_THR_MDL_INIT>` and `<TIG_THR_MDL_OFS>`.
        *   If `LV_TIG_MDL_FIL_SWI` is 0 (filter "offset only"), `x_in` is simply `<TIG_THR_MDL_OFS>`.
    *   This `x_in` then passes through a first-order lag filter block (labeled 'm', V.7.5), which presumably applies the filtering based on `<CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL>`.
    *   The output of this filter is the temporary filtered value, `<TIG_THR_FIL_TMP>`.

3.  **Final Filtered Temperature Calculation (`<TIG_THR>`):**
    *   `<TIG_THR_FIL_TMP>` is added to `<TIG_THR_MDL_INIT>`.
    *   This sum then passes through another first-order lag filter block (labeled 'm', V.7.5).
    *   The output of this second filter, after another potential initialization/reset switch (V.6.9), becomes the final filtered intake gas temperature, `<TIG_THR>`. This `<TIG_THR>` value is likely fed back into the `IP_CRLC_TIG_THR_MDL` look-up table for adaptive filtering.

These are indeed Simulink diagram snippets, likely representing parts of a larger automotive control system model, specifically for an intake gas temperature model at the intercooler.

## Function

The primary function of these Simulink diagrams is to define the initialization procedures and fundamental data flow for an "Intake Gas Temperature Model at Intercooler" (AIRT). They manage and update key internal variables such as `TIG_ICO_DOWN`, `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST`, and `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST_DC`, which likely represent different states or characteristics of the intake gas temperature downstream of the intercooler. The diagrams show how these variables are initialized at system reset and how they are updated during specific calculation steps and the overall operational mode.

## Inputs

Based on the green input blocks in the diagrams:

*   **`<TIG_ICO_MDL_INP>`**: A bus or grouped signal containing initial values for `TIG_ICO_DOWN`, `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST`, and `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST_DC` during system initialization.
*   **`<TIG_ICO_DOWN>`**: An input signal used to set the value of `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST` (likely representing a raw or pre-processed downstream temperature).
*   **`<TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST>`**: An input signal used to set the value of `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST_DC` (likely representing a state or calculated value based on `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST`).
*   **`<input>`**: A generic input for the overall operational mode of the intake gas temperature model, which is then stored as `TIG_ICO_MDL_INP`.

## Outputs

The primary "outputs" are updates to internal Data Stores, which function like global variables within the Simulink environment. The blue blocks labeled '1' with 'ini' or 'opm' are symbolic outputs indicating the completion of an initialization routine or an operational mode update, rather than carrying specific data values out of the depicted subsystem.

*   **Data Store `TIG_ICO_DOWN`**: Stores the initialized or updated intake gas temperature downstream.
*   **Data Store `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST`**: Stores the initialized or calculated state/sensor value of the downstream temperature.
*   **Data Store `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST_DC`**: Stores the initialized or calculated duty cycle/corrected value of the downstream temperature state.
*   **Data Store `TIG_ICO_MDL_INP`**: Stores the generic input for the operational model.
*   **Initialization Acknowledgment (`ini`)**: Signals the completion of specific initialization steps (Figure 3.14.1, 3.14.2, 3.14.3).
*   **Operational Mode Acknowledgment (`opm`)**: Signals that the operational update for the model has occurred (Figure 3.14.4).

## Logic Flow

The logical flow can be described step-by-step through each diagram:

1.  **3.14.1 Initialization at reset (Figure 3.14.1)**:
    *   An input signal, `<TIG_ICO_MDL_INP>`, is received. This signal is likely a bus containing multiple initial values.
    *   A Demultiplexer (implied by the converging lines from `<TIG_ICO_MDL_INP>` and diverging into three distinct signals) separates this input into three individual signals: `TIG_ICO_DOWN`, `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST`, and `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST_DC`.
    *   Each of these three signals is then written to its respective Data Store, using a Data Store Write block (indicated by 'V.6.4'). This effectively initializes these three internal variables.
    *   A symbolic output block labeled '1' with 'ini' signifies that this initialization sequence has been completed.

2.  **3.14.2 Calculation of TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST at ES2ERU (Figure 3.14.2)**:
    *   An input signal, `<TIG_ICO_DOWN>`, is received.
    *   This input value is directly written to the Data Store named `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST` using a Data Store Write block (V.6.4). This effectively updates or initializes `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST` with the value of `TIG_ICO_DOWN`.
    *   A symbolic output block labeled '1' with 'ini' indicates the completion of this specific initialization or update step. The presence of 'f(t)' and 'fc' in the top right suggests this might be executed as a function call within a larger system context.

3.  **3.14.3 Calculation of TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST_DC at DCON (Figure 3.14.3)**:
    *   An input signal, `<TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST>`, is received.
    *   This input value is directly written to the Data Store named `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST_DC` using a Data Store Write block (V.6.4). This updates or initializes `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST_DC` with the current value of `TIG_ICO_DOWN_ST`.
    *   A symbolic output block labeled '1' with 'ini' indicates the completion of this initialization or update step. Similar to 3.14.2, 'f(t)' and 'fc' suggest a function call context.

4.  **3.14.4 Overview of intake gas temperature model at intercooler (Figure 3.14.4)**:
    *   A generic input signal, `<input>`, is received.
    *   This input is written to the Data Store named `TIG_ICO_MDL_INP` using a Data Store Write block (V.6.4).
    *   Separately, a signal `TIG_ICO_DOWN` (likely sourced from an upstream calculation or a Data Store Read) is written to its corresponding Data Store, also named `TIG_ICO_DOWN`, via a Data Store Write block (V.6.4).
    *   A symbolic output block labeled '1' with 'opm' (likely for "operational mode") signifies the completion of these updates within the main operational cycle of the temperature model. This overview suggests how core model inputs are stored and how a key internal temperature variable is continuously updated.

This image contains two Simulink-like diagrams representing an automotive control system component.

## Function
The primary function of this system is to model the intake gas temperature in an engine, specifically considering the effects of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). This involves calculating various aspects of the intake gas temperature, such as upstream/downstream values, static states, and duty cycle considerations, under continuous operation and during system initialization or reset.

## Inputs
The key inputs to the system, derived from both diagrams, are:

*   **`<TEGR_H_AIRT>`**: Actual Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) High-side (H) temperature, likely from a sensor or another model. (Figure 3.15.1)
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_MDL_INP>`**: Intake Gas (IG) EGR High-side (H) Model Input, likely a reference or initial value for the intake gas temperature model. (Both Figures)
*   **`<fc_INI_AIRT_MDLAD_TIGEGR>`**: Function call trigger for the initialization of the `AIRT_MDLAD_TIGEGR` module. (Figure 3.15.1)
*   **`<fc_ES2ERU>`**: Function call trigger related to an ES2ERU (likely an Engine System management unit). (Figure 3.15.1)
*   **`<fc_DCON>`**: Function call trigger for deactivation control. (Figure 3.15.1)
*   **`fc()`**: A generic function call, acting as a trigger, specifically for initialization at reset. (Figure 3.15.2)
*   **`feedback`**: An internal feedback signal to the `INI X.1` block, contributing to the initialization state. (Figure 3.15.1)
*   **`tct()`**: A time-related signal, likely providing a clock or timing information for the `OPM X.2` block. (Figure 3.15.1)

## Outputs
The key outputs of the system, consistently shown in both diagrams, are:

*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_DOWN>`**: Intake Gas (IG) EGR High-side (H) Downstream temperature.
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_DOWN_ST>`**: Intake Gas (IG) EGR High-side (H) Downstream Static temperature.
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_DOWN_ST_DC>`**: Intake Gas (IG) EGR High-side (H) Downstream Static Duty Cycle temperature.
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_UP>`**: Intake Gas (IG) EGR High-side (H) Upstream temperature.
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_UP_ST>`**: Intake Gas (IG) EGR High-side (H) Upstream Static temperature.
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_UP_ST_DC>`**: Intake Gas (IG) EGR High-side (H) Upstream Static Duty Cycle temperature.
    (These outputs represent the various modeled intake gas temperatures, likely differentiated by location relative to a component (Up/Downstream) and measurement type (Static/Duty Cycle)).

## Logic Flow

The system's logic flow combines the operational model (Figure 3.15.1) with a specific reset initialization procedure (Figure 3.15.2).

1.  **Module Activation and Configuration (Figure 3.15.1 - Top Left Block):**
    *   The `AIRT_MDLAD_TIGEGR` module is configured to run `always` once initialized and is `never` deactivated, indicating continuous operation after setup.
    *   It defines various initialization conditions (`INI_AIRT_MDLAD_TIGEGR`, `ES2ERU`, `DCON`) and generates internal function call signals (`FC_INI_AIRT_MDLAD_TIGEGR`, `FC_OPM_AIRT_MDLAD_TIGEGR`) to orchestrate its sub-components.

2.  **Initialization at Reset (Figure 3.15.2):**
    *   When a generic function call `fc()` (interpreted as a reset or explicit initialization trigger) occurs, the `V.6.4` block becomes active.
    *   It takes `<TIG_EGR_H_MDL_INP>` as an input.
    *   This block assigns the input value (or a value derived from it during reset) directly to all six `TIG_EGR_H` output signals (`_DOWN`, `_DOWN_ST`, `_DOWN_ST_DC`, `_UP`, `_UP_ST`, `_UP_ST_DC`). This ensures a defined and consistent starting state for all modeled intake gas temperatures upon system reset. The `ini` output likely indicates completion or status of this initialization.

3.  **Ongoing Initialization/State Management (Figure 3.15.1 - INI X.1 Block):**
    *   During active operation, the `INI X.1` block manages the initialization and current state of the model.
    *   It receives various function call triggers (`<fc_INI_AIRT_MDLAD_TIGEGR>`, `<fc_ES2ERU>`, `<fc_DCON>`) which might cause it to update its internal state or perform specific setup routines.
    *   It also takes external temperature inputs (`<TEGR_H_AIRT>`, `<TIG_EGR_H_MDL_INP>`) and an internal `feedback` signal.
    *   The block processes these inputs to produce an `ini` output, representing the current initialization status or processed initialization data for the main calculation.

4.  **Operational Management/Pre-processing (Figure 3.15.1 - OPM X.2 Block):**
    *   The `OPM X.2` block handles operational management or pre-processing of data for the core temperature model.
    *   It receives relevant `input` data (likely including `<TEGR_H_AIRT>` and `<TIG_EGR_H_MDL_INP>`) and a time-related signal `tct()`, suggesting it might incorporate time-dependent dynamics or scheduling.
    *   It outputs `opm`, which contains processed data or control signals for the main calculation block.

5.  **Main Intake Gas Temperature Model Calculation (Figure 3.15.1 - V.6.7 Block):**
    *   This is the central computational block for the intake gas temperature model.
    *   It receives the `ini` signal from `INI X.1` (reflecting the current initialization/state), the `opm` signal from `OPM X.2` (providing operational data/parameters), and the direct input `<TIG_EGR_H_MDL_INP>`.
    *   Based on these inputs, the `V.6.7` block performs the core modeling and calculations to determine the current values for all six `TIG_EGR_H` output signals, accurately reflecting the intake gas temperature under various conditions, considering EGR.


--- Page 101 ---

The image displays three distinct Simulink-like diagrams that are part of an "Intake gas temperature model for exhaust gas recirculation." Each diagram details a specific aspect of calculating Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) high-side temperatures.

## Function

The primary function of this system is to model and calculate various exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) high-side temperatures. This includes determining upstream (UP) and downstream (DOWN) EGR temperatures under different operating conditions and for specific control strategies, such as "standard/static" (ST) and "decoupled" (DC) control, at different operating points (ES2ERU and DCON). The calculated temperatures are ultimately provided to a higher-level function for further system control, diagnostics, or modeling of the intake gas temperature.

## Inputs

Based on the three diagrams, the key inputs to the overall system are:

*   **`<input>`**: A generic input, likely serving as a mode selector, enable signal, or general parameter for the main model (seen in Figure 3.15.5).
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_MDL_INP>`**: A model-specific input for high-side EGR temperature calculation, potentially a combined signal that is subsequently split into upstream and downstream components (seen in Figure 3.15.5).
*   **`<TEGR_H_AIRT>`**: Intake Air Temperature specifically relevant to the EGR high-side system, likely used for compensation or blending (seen in Figure 3.15.5).
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_DOWN>`**: Raw or base downstream high-side EGR temperature, used as an input for static temperature calculation (seen in Figure 3.15.3).
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_UP>`**: Raw or base upstream high-side EGR temperature, used as an input for static temperature calculation (seen in Figure 3.15.3).
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_DOWN_ST>`**: The standard/static downstream high-side EGR temperature, used as an input for decoupled temperature calculation (seen in Figure 3.15.4).
*   **`<TIG_EGR_H_UP_ST>`**: The standard/static upstream high-side EGR temperature, used as an input for decoupled temperature calculation (seen in Figure 3.15.4).

## Outputs

The system produces several intermediate and final temperature values, which are then passed to a generic function `f()`. The key outputs are:

*   **`TIG_EGR_H_DOWN`**: Calculated downstream high-side EGR temperature (from the demultiplexer-like block in Figure 3.15.5).
*   **`TIG_EGR_H_UP`**: Calculated upstream high-side EGR temperature (from the demultiplexer-like block in Figure 3.15.5).
*   **`TIG_EGR_H_DOWN_ST`**: Standard or static downstream high-side EGR temperature at the ES2ERU operating point (from Figure 3.15.3).
*   **`TIG_EGR_H_UP_ST`**: Standard or static upstream high-side EGR temperature at the ES2ERU operating point (from Figure 3.15.3).
*   **`TIG_EGR_H_DOWN_ST_DC`**: Decoupled (dynamic control) downstream high-side EGR temperature at the DCON operating point (from Figure 3.15.4).
*   **`TIG_EGR_H_UP_ST_DC`**: Decoupled (dynamic control) upstream high-side EGR temperature at the DCON operating point (from Figure 3.15.4).

The final output of each sub-model is a merged signal, representing the calculated temperatures relevant to that specific step, which is then fed into a generic function block `f()`.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow can be understood as a hierarchical model with specialized sub-functions for different EGR temperature calculations:

1.  **Core EGR Temperature Extraction/Derivation (Implicitly from Figure 3.15.5):**
    *   The model receives `<TIG_EGR_H_MDL_INP>`, which represents high-side EGR temperature data. This input is then processed (likely split or derived within a subsystem) to produce two distinct signals: `TIG_EGR_H_DOWN` (downstream temperature) and `TIG_EGR_H_UP` (upstream temperature).
    *   Concurrently, an intake air temperature for EGR, `<TEGR_H_AIRT>`, is received and potentially processed by an unnamed block (marked with 'E'), which might perform enabling logic or a specific transformation.
    *   A generic `<input>` signal is also received by the overall model.

2.  **Standard/Static Temperature Calculation at ES2ERU (Figure 3.15.3):**
    *   The raw or base EGR temperatures, `<TIG_EGR_H_DOWN>` and `<TIG_EGR_H_UP>` (which could be the outputs from step 1, or specific inputs to this sub-function), are fed into dedicated "V.6.4" blocks.
    *   Each "V.6.4" block likely applies a specific model, calculation, or lookup table to derive the "standard" or "static" EGR high-side temperatures for the ES2ERU operating point: `TIG_EGR_H_DOWN_ST` and `TIG_EGR_H_UP_ST`.
    *   These two static temperature outputs are then combined (multiplexed) and passed through a block labeled "1" (with the annotation "ini", suggesting initialization or a specific state), which subsequently feeds into a generic function call block `f()`.

3.  **Decoupled Temperature Calculation at DCON (Figure 3.15.4):**
    *   The standard/static temperatures, `<TIG_EGR_H_DOWN_ST>` and `<TIG_EGR_H_UP_ST>` (likely sourced from the previous calculation stage or specific inputs for this sub-function), are fed into separate "V.6.4" blocks.
    *   These "V.6.4" blocks perform further calculations, possibly adjusting the static temperatures for dynamic control or decoupling purposes at the DCON operating point, resulting in `TIG_EGR_H_DOWN_ST_DC` and `TIG_EGR_H_UP_ST_DC`.
    *   Similar to the previous stage, these two decoupled temperature outputs are combined, passed through a block labeled "1" (with "ini" annotation), and then fed into a generic function call block `f()`.

4.  **Overall Model Integration (Continued from Figure 3.15.5):**
    *   The initially derived `TIG_EGR_H_DOWN` and `TIG_EGR_H_UP` signals (from step 1) are also fed into another "V.6.4" block within the main overview diagram. This instance of "V.6.4" likely performs a core calculation for the overall intake gas temperature model.
    *   The outputs of this "V.6.4" block, along with the processed `<TEGR_H_AIRT>` and the generic `<input>`, are then collectively routed through a combined signal path.
    *   This combined signal passes through a block labeled "1" (with the annotation "opm", suggesting an overall primary model or operating mode context), which finally feeds into a generic function call block `f()`, signifying the aggregated output of the entire intake gas temperature model.

The "V.6.4" blocks consistently appear, indicating they are reusable components or sub-functions performing a standardized calculation or modeling step for EGR temperatures. The "f()" blocks represent the ultimate destination where the calculated temperatures are utilized by the broader automotive control system.

This image contains two Simulink-style block diagrams, clearly representing logic for automotive diagnostics.

## Function

The primary function of this system is to perform an electrical diagnosis for an air temperature sensor, specifically identifying Open Circuit (OC) and Short Circuit to Ground (SCG) conditions, and potentially Short Circuit to Plus conditions. It processes raw sensor data, applies diagnostic logic (including inhibition and voltage threshold checks), and outputs a consolidated bus containing diagnostic states and relevant parameters.

Figure 319.2 provides an "Overview of electrical diagnosis," processing two main fault types (OC and SCG) potentially for multiple sensors or iterations. Figure 319.3 details the specific "Electrical diagnosis open circuit / shortcut to plus" logic, showing how one of the diagnostic states (for Open Circuit) is determined.

## Inputs

The key inputs to the overall system, as derived from both diagrams, are:

*   **`NC_NR_LTS_AIR`**: A parameter (likely a number or size) determining the iteration count for the diagnostic process (e.g., number of sensors or diagnostic slots).
*   **`VP_LTS_AIR`**: The voltage or value read from the air temperature sensor. This is a crucial input for fault condition evaluation.
*   **`C_VP_LTS_AIR_OC`**: A threshold constant representing the voltage limit for detecting an Open Circuit condition.
*   **`C_VP_LTS_AIR_SCG`**: A threshold constant representing the voltage limit for detecting a Short Circuit to Ground condition.
*   **`<input>`**: A generic input to a multiplexer, which might serve as a default value or an alternative input path for diagnostic processing.
*   **`LV_CDN_VB_OBD1`**: A boolean signal indicating if a specific voltage condition for OBD1 diagnostics is met.

## Outputs

The main output of the overall system is:

*   **`clc_diag_el`**: A bus containing the merged electrical diagnostic information. This bus likely encapsulates an array of diagnostic structures, each containing details for both Open Circuit and Short Circuit to Ground conditions, and their respective states, possibly organized per sensor or iteration.

Intermediate outputs, critical for the internal flow:

*   **`LV_CDN_LTS_AIR_OC`**: A boolean signal indicating if the Open Circuit condition for the air temperature sensor is met.
*   **`LF_STATE_DGO_LTS_AIR_OC`**: A numeric value (e.g., 0.0, 1.0, 3.0) representing the diagnostic state/fault code for the air temperature sensor Open Circuit.
*   **`LV_INH_ERR_LTS_AIR_OC`**: A boolean signal indicating if the Open Circuit error diagnosis is inhibited.
*   **`LV_INH_ERR_LTS_AIR_SCG`**: A boolean signal indicating if the Short Circuit to Ground error diagnosis is inhibited.
*   **`LF_STATE_DGO_LTS_AIR_SCG`**: The diagnostic state/fault code for the air temperature sensor Short Circuit to Ground.
*   **`DIAG_EL_OC`**: An internal bus specifically for Open Circuit diagnostic data.
*   **`DIAG_EL_SCG`**: An internal bus specifically for Short Circuit to Ground diagnostic data.

## Logic Flow

The logical flow combines the overview (Figure 319.2) with the detailed fault logic (Figure 319.3) as a sub-component.

1.  **Iteration Setup (Figure 319.2):** The `For Iterator` block indicates that the subsequent diagnostic logic runs for `NC_NR_LTS_AIR` iterations. This allows for processing multiple sensors or different diagnostic test cycles.

2.  **Parallel Fault Diagnosis (Figure 319.2):** Inside the iteration, the system branches into two parallel paths: one dedicated to Open Circuit (`_OC`) diagnosis and another for Short Circuit to Ground (`_SCG`) diagnosis. Each path shares a similar structure.

3.  **Data Preprocessing and Signal Generation (within each branch, Figure 319.2):**
    *   In each path, a multiplexer selects between a default `<input>` and the specific constant threshold (`C_VP_LTS_AIR_OC` or `C_VP_LTS_AIR_SCG`).
    *   This selected signal, along with the raw/processed `VP_LTS_AIR` from the sensor, enters a "read" block (V.6.9). This block acts as a data acquisition/signal processing unit, outputting several key signals for the specific fault type:
        *   `VP_LTS_AIR` (likely a processed version of the sensor reading).
        *   `LV_INH_ERR_LTS_AIR_OC` (or `_SCG`) indicating if the error diagnosis is temporarily inhibited.
        *   `C_VP_LTS_AIR_OC` (or `_SCG`) (the threshold, passed through).
        *   `LV_CDN_VB_OBD1` (the OBD1 voltage condition).

4.  **Detailed Open Circuit Logic (Figure 319.3, applied to the `_OC` branch):**
    *   **Inhibition & OBD1 Check:** The `LV_INH_ERR_LTS_AIR_OC` signal is inverted by a `NOT` gate (V.6.3). The result is then combined with `LV_CDN_VB_OBD1` via an `AND` gate (V.6.6). This means the diagnosis is active and the condition is met if the error is *not* inhibited AND the OBD1 voltage condition is true. The output of this `AND` gate directly determines `LV_CDN_LTS_AIR_OC`.
    *   **Voltage Threshold Check:** The processed `VP_LTS_AIR` is compared against `C_VP_LTS_AIR_OC` using a `>` operator (V.6.2) to see if the sensor voltage exceeds the open circuit threshold.
    *   **Conditional State Assignment (First Switch):** The result of the voltage comparison controls a `Switch` block (V.6.6). If `VP_LTS_AIR > C_VP_LTS_AIR_OC` is true, the `CDN SYM` value (3.0) is selected; otherwise, `CDN NO-SYM` (1.0) is selected. These values likely represent a qualitative assessment of the open circuit severity.
    *   **Final Diagnostic State Assignment (Second Switch):** The output of the first switch is fed into a second `Switch` block (V.6.6). This switch is controlled by the output of the `AND` gate (i.e., whether the diagnosis is active and condition met). If the `AND` gate is true, the state from the first switch is passed through. If the `AND` gate is false (diagnosis inhibited or OBD1 condition not met), the output defaults to `NO-CDN NO-SYM` (0.0). The final output of this second switch is `LF_STATE_DGO_LTS_AIR_OC`.

5.  **Short Circuit to Ground Logic (Figure 319.2):** A similar detailed logic (analogous to Figure 319.3 but with `_SCG` specific parameters and thresholds) is implicitly applied to the `_SCG` branch to determine `LF_STATE_DGO_LTS_AIR_SCG` and `LV_CDN_LTS_AIR_SCG`.

6.  **Bus Creation (Figure 319.2):** For each fault path, the various derived signals (e.g., `VP_LTS_AIR`, inhibit status, thresholds, and the computed diagnostic state `LF_STATE_DGO_LTS_AIR_OC/SCG`) are grouped into specific diagnostic buses: `DIAG_EL_OC` (X.1.1.1) and `DIAG_EL_SCG` (X.1.1.2).

7.  **Demultiplexing and Merging (Figure 319.2):**
    *   These `DIAG_EL_OC` and `DIAG_EL_SCG` buses, which are outputs of the iterative loop, are passed through demultiplexers (V.7.10) sized by `NC_NR_LTS_AIR`. This forms arrays of diagnostic buses, one for each iteration/sensor for both OC and SCG faults.
    *   Finally, a `BusMerge` block (V.6.4) consolidates these arrays of diagnostic buses into the single, comprehensive output bus `clc_diag_el`, providing a complete electrical diagnosis for the air temperature sensor(s).

## Function
The primary function of these Simulink diagrams is to perform comprehensive diagnostics for an automotive air temperature sensor system. This includes identifying specific electrical faults, such as a "shortcut to ground," and assessing general sensor health for "out-of-range" (high and low) conditions, as well as detecting "intermittent" sensor malfunctions. The system aims to generate various diagnostic flags and robust state information for further system management.

## Inputs
The key inputs to this system are:

*   **`<LV_CDN_VB_OBD1>` (and indexed versions):** Boolean flag(s) indicating an OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) related voltage condition, possibly indicating a supply voltage issue relevant to sensor operation.
*   **`<LV_INH_ERR_LTS_AIR_SCG>` (and indexed versions):** Boolean flag(s) to inhibit (prevent) the detection of a "low temperature sensor air shortcut to ground" error, or similar out-of-range/intermittent errors for specific instances.
*   **`<VP_LTS_AIR>`:** The primary physical value measured by the Low Temperature Sensor (LTS) for air, likely representing the air temperature.
*   **`<C_VP_LTS_AIR_SCG>`:** A constant threshold value used to detect a "shortcut to ground" fault for the air temperature sensor.
*   **`CDN_SYM`, `CDN_NO-SYM`, `NO-CDN NO-SYM`:** Constants (+3.0, +1.0, +0.0 respectively) likely used for state transitions or conditions within the diagnostic logic for shortcut to ground.
*   **`<NC_NR_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM>`:** An integer representing the number of instances or channels for which "Temperature Low Temperature Sensor Air Out of Range and Intermittent" diagnosis needs to be performed. This drives the For Iterator block.
*   **`<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_i>`:** Indexed actual sensor value or related input for the i-th instance of the out-of-range/intermittent diagnosis.
*   **`<C_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H_i>`:** Indexed constant high limit threshold for "out of range high" detection for the i-th instance.
*   **`<C_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L_i>`:** Indexed constant low limit threshold for "out of range low" detection for the i-th instance.
*   **`<C_TLTS_AIR_DIF_INTM_i>`:** Indexed constant difference threshold for "intermittent" diagnosis for the i-th instance.
*   **`<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_MMV_i>`:** Indexed moving average or filtered sensor value, likely used in the intermittent diagnosis logic for the i-th instance.
*   **`<LV_TLTS_AIR_INTM_CLR_DIAG_i>`:** Indexed boolean flag to clear the intermittent diagnosis for the i-th instance.
*   **`<LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H_i>`, `<LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L_i>`:** Indexed current lifecycle state of the diagnostic object for "out of range high" and "out of range low" faults, respectively, potentially used for feedback or state-dependent logic.

## Outputs
The key outputs generated by this system are:

*   **`<LV_CDN_LTS_AIR_SCG>`:** A boolean flag indicating that a "Low Temperature Sensor Air Shortcut to Ground" condition has been detected.
*   **`<LF_STATE_DGO_LTS_AIR_SCG>`:** The lifecycle state of the diagnostic object for the "Low Temperature Sensor Air Shortcut to Ground" fault, likely an enumerated state (e.g., passed, failed, debouncing).
*   **`clc_diag`:** A merged bus containing structured diagnostic data for all `N` instances of the "out-of-range" (high/low) and "intermittent" conditions. This bus consolidates the diagnostic results into a single output.

## Logic Flow

The overall logic flow is divided into two main parts as depicted in Figure 319.4 and Figure 319.5:

### Part 1: Electrical Diagnosis Shortcut to Ground (Figure 319.4)

1.  **Condition Flag Generation (`<LV_CDN_LTS_AIR_SCG>`):**
    *   The `NOT` of the inhibit error flag (`<LV_INH_ERR_LTS_AIR_SCG>`) is combined with the OBD voltage condition flag (`<LV_CDN_VB_OBD1>`) using an `AND` gate (V.6.3).
    *   The output of the `AND` gate feeds into a memory/latch block (V.6.4), which likely holds the `shortcut to ground` condition active once detected, thereby setting the boolean output `<LV_CDN_LTS_AIR_SCG>`.

2.  **Diagnostic Object State Generation (`<LF_STATE_DGO_LTS_AIR_SCG>`):**
    *   The measured air temperature sensor value (`<VP_LTS_AIR>`) is compared against a constant threshold (`<C_VP_LTS_AIR_SCG>`) using a "less than" comparator (V.6.5). This indicates if the sensor reading is below the threshold, potentially due to a shortcut to ground.
    *   The result of this comparison, along with several constant signals (`CDN_SYM`, `CDN_NO-SYM`, `NO-CDN NO-SYM`), feeds into a series of "Check" blocks (V.6.6). These blocks typically implement debouncing logic, hysteresis, or a state machine to ensure the fault is persistent and valid before setting the diagnostic object state.
    *   The final output of this sequence of "Check" blocks is the robust diagnostic object state, `<LF_STATE_DGO_LTS_AIR_SCG>`, indicating the status of the shortcut to ground fault (e.g., active, inactive, debouncing).

### Part 2: Overview of Out of Range and Intermittent Diagnosis (Figure 319.5)

1.  **Iterative Processing:**
    *   A `For Iterator` block initiates a loop that runs `N` times, where `N` is specified by the input `<NC_NR_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM>`. This allows the same diagnostic logic to be applied to multiple instances (e.g., different sensors, different diagnostic criteria, or simply an array of data).
    *   Inside the loop, for each iteration `i`, specific indexed inputs (`_i`) are selected and fed into parallel diagnostic sub-systems.

2.  **Out-of-Range High Diagnosis (Conceptual `DIAG_ORNG_H` Sub-system):**
    *   For each instance `i`, the actual sensor value (`<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_i>`) is compared against a high limit threshold (`<C_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H_i>`).
    *   This comparison, combined with an inhibit flag (`<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H_i>`), OBD voltage condition (`<LV_CDN_VB_OBD1_i>`), and potentially previous diagnostic states (`<LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H_i>`), determines if an "out of range high" fault exists.
    *   The logic within this conceptual sub-system (represented by the input block and subsequent connection) would typically include debouncing and state management to generate a robust diagnostic output.

3.  **Out-of-Range Low Diagnosis (Conceptual `DIAG_ORNG_L` Sub-system):**
    *   Similar to the high diagnosis, for each instance `i`, the sensor value (`<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_i>`) is compared against a low limit threshold (`<C_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L_i>`).
    *   This comparison, along with its corresponding inhibit flag (`<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L_i>`), OBD condition, and previous states, determines if an "out of range low" fault exists.
    *   This conceptual sub-system (represented by its input block and connection) also generates a robust diagnostic output.

4.  **Intermittent Diagnosis (Conceptual `DIAG_INTM` Sub-system):**
    *   For each instance `i`, the sensor value (`<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_i>`) is likely compared to a filtered or moving average value (`<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_MMV_i>`) to detect sudden or erratic changes, against a difference threshold (`<C_TLTS_AIR_DIF_INTM_i>`).
    *   This detection is influenced by an inhibit flag (`<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_INTM_i>`), OBD condition, and an intermittent diagnosis clear flag (`<LV_TLTS_AIR_INTM_CLR_DIAG_i>`).
    *   This conceptual sub-system (represented by its input block and connection) would employ specific logic (e.g., windowing, statistical analysis) to detect intermittent faults.

5.  **Result Aggregation and Merging:**
    *   The outputs from all `N` iterations of the "out-of-range high," "out-of-range low," and "intermittent" diagnostic sub-systems are collected.
    *   `C_u` blocks (V.7.10, likely representing concatenate blocks that build an array of signals) gather these outputs for all instances.
    *   Finally, these concatenated arrays are combined into a single structured bus output, `clc_diag`, using a `BusMerge` block (V.6.4). This bus provides a consolidated view of all diagnostic states and flags for the air temperature sensor system.

The image displays two Simulink-style block diagrams, Figure 3.196 and Figure 3.197, which describe diagnostic logic for an air temperature sensor. These diagrams are part of a larger document titled "AIRT. Air temperature sensor diagnosis".

## Function
The primary function of these diagrams is to perform "out of range" diagnostics for an air temperature sensor.
*   **Figure 3.196 (Out of range high diagnosis):** Detects if the air temperature sensor reading exceeds a predefined high limit.
*   **Figure 3.197 (Out of range low diagnosis):** Detects if the air temperature sensor reading falls below a predefined low limit.

For both high and low range conditions, the system determines:
1.  A "Condition Detected" flag, indicating that the sensor value is outside the acceptable range, subject to inhibition and readiness conditions.
2.  A "Diagnostic State" flag, typically used for more robust fault management (e.g., setting a Diagnostic Trouble Code - DTC), which usually involves debouncing or hysteresis.

## Inputs
**Common Inputs for both High and Low Range Diagnosis:**
*   `<LV_CDN_VB_OBD1>`: A Boolean signal indicating an OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) readiness condition or overall diagnostic enable. (e.g., true when OBD monitoring is active).

**Specific Inputs for Figure 3.196 (Out of range high diagnosis):**
*   `<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H>`: A Boolean signal that, when true, inhibits the "out of range high" error detection.
*   `<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_H>`: An intermediate or filtered air temperature sensor value that is being checked against the high limit.
*   `<C_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H>`: A constant value representing the high temperature threshold for the sensor.

**Specific Inputs for Figure 3.197 (Out of range low diagnosis):**
*   `<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L>`: A Boolean signal that, when true, inhibits the "out of range low" error detection.
*   `<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_L>`: An intermediate or filtered air temperature sensor value that is being checked against the low limit.
*   `<C_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L>`: A constant value representing the low temperature threshold for the sensor.

## Outputs
**Specific Outputs for Figure 3.196 (Out of range high diagnosis):**
*   `<LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H>`: A Boolean signal indicating that the "out of range high" condition has been detected and confirmed (Condition Detected, TLTS Air Out of Range High).
*   `<LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H>`: A signal representing the "out of range high" diagnostic state, typically for fault storage or DTC activation (Diagnostic State, TLTS Air Out of Range High).

**Specific Outputs for Figure 3.197 (Out of range low diagnosis):**
*   `<LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L>`: A Boolean signal indicating that the "out of range low" condition has been detected and confirmed (Condition Detected, TLTS Air Out of Range Low).
*   `<LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L>`: A signal representing the "out of range low" diagnostic state (Diagnostic State, TLTS Air Out of Range Low).

## Logic Flow

Both diagrams follow a very similar logic structure, differing primarily in the comparison operator (">" for high, "<" for low) and the specific inhibit/threshold signals.

**Step-by-step Logic (generalized for both high and low range):**

1.  **Inhibition and Readiness Check:**
    *   The respective inhibit signal (`<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H>` or `<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L>`) is passed through a NOT gate. This means the diagnostic is active only if the error *is not* inhibited.
    *   The output of the NOT gate is combined with the general diagnostic readiness signal (`<LV_CDN_VB_OBD1>`) using an AND gate. This final Boolean output dictates whether the diagnostic monitoring is currently enabled. Let's call this the "Diagnosis Active" signal.

2.  **Sensor Value Comparison:**
    *   For **high range** (Figure 3.196): The intermediate air temperature value (`<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_H>`) is compared with the high limit (`<C_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H>`) using a ">" (greater than) relational operator. A true output indicates the temperature is too high.
    *   For **low range** (Figure 3.197): The intermediate air temperature value (`<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_L>`) is compared with the low limit (`<C_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L>`) using a "<" (less than) relational operator. A true output indicates the temperature is too low.
    *   Let's call the output of this comparison the "Raw Out-of-Range Condition".

3.  **Condition Flag (`LV_CDN...`) Debounce and Logic (Upper Path):**
    *   The "Raw Out-of-Range Condition" feeds into a debouncer/state machine often referred to as a "symptom conditioner". This is represented by the interconnected blocks labeled "CDN SYM", "CDN NO-SYM", and the switch controlled by "Check ~= 0".
    *   "CDN SYM" (Condition Symptom) implies that when the "Raw Out-of-Range Condition" is true, a counter (or timer) is incremented or a state is set (e.g., value +3.0e+000).
    *   "CDN NO-SYM" (Condition No Symptom) implies that when the "Raw Out-of-Range Condition" is false, the counter is decremented or the state is reset (e.g., value +1.0e+000).
    *   The switch controlled by "Check ~= 0" confirms the symptom after a certain duration or count. If "Check ~= 0" (meaning the counter has reached a positive threshold, indicating persistent fault), the symptom is confirmed.
    *   A primary switch (controlled by the "Diagnosis Active" signal from Step 1) determines the final condition flag:
        *   If "Diagnosis Active" is TRUE, the output of the debouncer/symptom conditioner (confirmed raw condition) is passed through.
        *   If "Diagnosis Active" is FALSE, a constant "NO-CDN NO-SYM" (likely representing '0' or 'false', indicating no condition detected) is output.
    *   This final output is the respective `<LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H>` or `<LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L>` signal.

4.  **Diagnostic State (`LF_STATE_DGO...`) Debounce and Logic (Lower Path):**
    *   This path mirrors the Condition Flag logic but often with different debounce thresholds or timing characteristics, typically designed for more rigorous fault detection leading to DTC storage.
    *   The "Raw Out-of-Range Condition" feeds into a second, independent debouncer/state machine with similar "CDN SYM", "CDN NO-SYM", and "Check ~= 0" blocks. This debouncer might have longer timers or different reset logic compared to the first.
    *   A secondary switch (also controlled by the "Diagnosis Active" signal from Step 1) determines the final diagnostic state:
        *   If "Diagnosis Active" is TRUE, the output of this second debouncer (confirmed diagnostic state) is passed through.
        *   If "Diagnosis Active" is FALSE, a constant "NO-CDN NO-SYM" (likely '0' or 'false') is output.
    *   This final output is the respective `<LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_H>` or `<LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_ORNG_L>` signal.

## Function
The system is designed for "Air temperature sensor diagnosis," specifically focusing on detecting and defining intermittent faults. It comprises two main logical sections:

1.  **Figure 3.19.8: Diagnostic Condition and Signal Filtering:** This section determines when the conditions for an intermittent air temperature diagnosis are active (`LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_INTM`) based on system states (clear requests, error inhibitions, and OBD1 readiness). Simultaneously, it processes the raw intermittent air temperature signal (`TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM`) through a filter to generate a smoothed representation (`TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_MMV`).
2.  **Figure 3.19.9: Intermittent Error State Definition:** This section uses the filtered and raw temperature values, calculates their deviation, and combines this information with the diagnostic condition flag (`LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_INTM`) to assign a final, prioritized numerical state (`LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_INTM`) indicating the nature and severity of the intermittent air temperature fault.

## Inputs

**Common Inputs to the overall system:**
*   `<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM>`: The raw, original intermittent air temperature signal (e.g., float).

**Specific to Figure 3.19.8:**
*   `<LV_TLTS_AIR_INTM_CLR_DIAG>`: A Boolean flag (true/false) used to request clearing of the intermittent diagnosis.
*   `<LV_CDN_VB_OBD1>`: A Boolean flag (true/false) indicating if the OBD1 (On-Board Diagnostics) voltage condition is met.
*   `<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_INTM>`: A Boolean flag (true/false) used to inhibit (prevent) the detection of the intermittent air temperature error.
*   `C_CRLC_TLTS_AIR_INTM`: A constant or parameter (float) defining the rate limit or filtering characteristic for the air temperature signal.

**Specific to Figure 3.19.9:**
*   `<C_TLTS_AIR_DIF_INTM>`: A constant threshold value (float) representing the maximum allowable difference for an intermittent air temperature deviation.
*   `CDN SYM`: A constant numerical value (e.g., 3.0) representing a diagnostic state for a 'Symmetric Condition'.
*   `CDN NO-SYM`: A constant numerical value (e.g., 1.0) representing a diagnostic state for a 'Non-Symmetric Condition'.
*   `NO-CDN NO-SYM`: A constant numerical value (e.g., 0.0) representing a diagnostic state for 'No Condition, No Symmetric fault'.

## Outputs

**Specific to Figure 3.19.8:**
*   `<LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_INTM>`: A Boolean flag (true/false) indicating that the diagnostic conditions for intermittent air temperature are active.
*   `<TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_MMV>`: The Moving Mean Value (filtered/smoothed) of the intermittent air temperature signal (e.g., float).

**Specific to Figure 3.19.9:**
*   `<LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_INTM>`: The final numerical state (float) of the diagnostic object for intermittent air temperature, representing different fault conditions.

## Logic Flow

**Figure 3.19.8: Diagnostic Condition and Signal Filtering**

1.  **Set Condition for Diagnosis Flag:**
    *   The `LV_TLTS_AIR_INTM_CLR_DIAG` signal is inverted (NOT gate V.6.3).
    *   The `LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_INTM` signal is also inverted (NOT gate V.6.3).
    *   These two inverted signals, along with the `LV_CDN_VB_OBD1` signal, are logically combined using an `AND` gate (V.6.6). The output of this `AND` gate (let's call it `SET_COND`) is true if the diagnosis is not being cleared, error detection is not inhibited, and the OBD1 voltage condition is met.
2.  **Diagnostic Flag Latching (LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_INTM):**
    *   The `SET_COND` signal is fed as one input to an `OR` gate (V.6.7).
    *   The current output of the Memory/State block (V.6.8), which holds the state of `LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_INTM`, is inverted by a `NOT` gate (V.6.8) and fed as the second input to the `OR` gate (V.6.7).
    *   The output of the `OR` gate becomes the input (`u`) for the Memory/State block (V.6.8), thus defining the next state of `LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_INTM`. The logic implies `LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_INTM (next) = SET_COND OR NOT(LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_INTM (current))`.
    *   (Note: This specific latching behavior causes the flag to set high when `SET_COND` is true, but to toggle between true and false if `SET_COND` becomes false. This is a non-standard implementation for a persistent diagnostic flag which typically latches until explicitly reset).
3.  **Intermittent Air Temperature Signal Filtering:**
    *   The raw intermittent air temperature signal (`TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM`) is passed through a dedicated Rate Limiter or Filter block (V.7.5). This block uses the parameter `C_CRLC_TLTS_AIR_INTM` to smooth the input signal over time, producing the `TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_MMV` output, which is a filtered or moving mean version of the raw temperature.

**Figure 3.19.9: Intermittent Error State Definition**

1.  **Absolute Difference Calculation:**
    *   The filtered air temperature (`TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM_MMV`) and the raw air temperature (`TLTS_AIR_ORNG_INTM`) are subtracted (Sum block V.7.5).
    *   The absolute value of this difference is then calculated (Absolute block V.7.13).
2.  **Difference Threshold Check:**
    *   The absolute difference is compared against the constant threshold `C_TLTS_AIR_DIF_INTM` using a `>` (greater than) relational operator (V.6.2). This comparison yields a Boolean result (true if the difference exceeds the threshold).
3.  **Prioritized Diagnostic State Assignment (LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_INTM):**
    *   Three state blocks (V.6.6), functioning as a series of prioritized conditional assignments, determine the final diagnostic state:
        *   **Condition 1 (Highest Priority):** If the `(Absolute Difference > C_TLTS_AIR_DIF_INTM)` is true (and an internal 'Check ~= 0' condition of the first block is met), the output `LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_INTM` is assigned the value of `CDN SYM` (e.g., 3.0).
        *   **Condition 2 (Next Priority):** Otherwise (if Condition 1 is false), and if the `LV_CDN_TLTS_AIR_INTM` flag (from Figure 3.19.8) is true (and an internal 'Check ~= 0' condition of the second block is met), the output `LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_INTM` is assigned the value of `CDN NO-SYM` (e.g., 1.0).
        *   **Condition 3 (Lowest Priority/Default):** Otherwise (if both Conditions 1 and 2 are false, and an internal 'Check == 0' condition of the third block is met), the output `LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_INTM` is assigned the value of `NO-CDN NO-SYM` (e.g., 0.0).

This image displays a Simulink diagram representing an automotive diagnostic function.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to perform **air temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis (AIRT)**. This involves continuously monitoring and evaluating the air temperature sensor's readings and associated system states to determine if the sensor is providing plausible and reliable data. It operates periodically to update the diagnostic status and related parameters.

## Inputs
The system receives various inputs, which can be categorized into control/status signals and actual measurement/model data:

*   **Initialization/Control Signals:**
    *   `RST`: System reset signal.
    *   `IGKON`: Ignition ON signal.
    *   `NVMINI`: Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) initialization signal.
    *   `NVMMINI`: NVM mirror initialization signal.
    *   `NVMSTO`: NVM storage signal.
    *   `NC_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_CONF`: Configuration flag for air temperature sensor plausibility.
    *   `<LV_IGKON>`: Logical Ignition ON status.

    *   `<TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_MES>`: Measured air temperature value (from the sensor).
    *   `<NC_NR_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS>`: Configuration for the number of air temperature sensor plausibility checks.
    *   `<GV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_CUR_DIAG>`: Global variable for current air temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis.

## Outputs
The system produces numerous diagnostic states and intermediate values, bundled into a structure and a primary diagnostic status:

*   **Primary Diagnostic Status:**
    *   `<LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS>`: Logical Fault State Diagnostic Object for Air Temperature Sensor Plausibility – this is the main output indicating the overall plausibility status (e.g., OK, fault, pending).

*   **Detailed Diagnostic Outputs (via V.6.5 structure):**
    *   `CTR_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`: Counter for air temperature sensor plausibility stability.
    *   `CTR_STAB_MIN_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`: Minimum stability counter for air temperature sensor plausibility.
    *   `LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`: (Duplicated as main output) Logical Fault State Diagnostic Object.
    *   `LV_CON_DIAG_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`: Logical flag for air temperature sensor plausibility diagnostic conditions.
    *   `LV_REAC_INH_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`: Logical flag for reaction inhibition of air temperature sensor plausibility.
    *   `LV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_ACT`: Logical flag indicating air temperature sensor plausibility is active.
    *   `STATE_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`: State variable for air temperature sensor plausibility stability.

    *   `TEMP_DIF_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_DC`: Temperature difference for air temperature sensor plausibility (with DC component).
    *   `TEMP_DIF_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_GY`: Temperature difference for air temperature sensor plausibility (with GY component, possibly gyro or dynamic).

    *   `TEMP_STAB_MIN_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`: Minimum temperature stability for plausibility.
    *   `TEMP_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`: Temperature stability for air temperature sensor plausibility.

## Logic Flow

1.  **Periodic Execution and Activation (Top-left subsystem):**
    *   The entire diagnosis routine is scheduled to execute periodically every **1 second (`Recurrence: 1S`)**.
    *   An "Init:" block within this subsystem defines various initialization conditions based on system signals like `RST` (reset), `IGKON` (ignition on), `NVMINI` (NVM initialization), `NVMMINI` (NVM mirror initialization), `NVMSTO` (NVM storage), and `NC_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_CONF` (configuration for plausibility). These conditions generate an `fc_INI` signal.
    *   A "Deactivation:" logic, based on `!activation_not_true`, generates an `fc_OPM_1S` signal, implying that the diagnostic algorithm is started only when an explicit activation flag is true. This confirms the text below the diagram: "The actual plausibility diagnosis is started as soon as the activation flag is set."

2.  **Initialization Block (INI X.1):**
    *   The `INI` block receives the initialization signals (`fc_RST`, `fc_IGKON`, `fc_NVMINI`, `fc_NVMMINI`, `fc_NVMSTO`) derived from the top-left subsystem. These signals (after an AND operation) trigger specific initialization routines within the `INI` block. This block is responsible for setting initial states, counters, and parameters required for the plausibility checks, especially after system resets or ignition cycles.

3.  **Input Processing (fc() block):**
    *   A block labeled `fc()` receives a multitude of input signals including various logical states (`LV_CON_VB_OBD2`, `LV_IGKON`, `LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`, `LV_ST_END`, `LV_STATE_TLTS_MDL_UP`, `LV_STATE_TLTS_MES_UP`), the air temperature values from the model (`TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_MDL`) and the sensor (`TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_MES`), configuration (`NC_NR_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`), and a current diagnostic global variable (`GV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_CUR_DIAG`). This `fc()` block likely performs preliminary processing, such as input conditioning, filtering, or basic comparisons, preparing the data for the core plausibility checks.

4.  **Core Plausibility Logic (OPM_1S X.2):**
    *   The output of the `fc()` block feeds into the `OPM_1S` block. This block, likely standing for "Operation Mode 1-second" or "Plausibility Manager 1-second," represents the heart of the plausibility diagnosis. It integrates the conditioned input data with the initialization states from the `INI` block (implicitly, as both are part of the overall flow). Within `OPM_1S`, algorithms evaluate:
        *   **Rationality:** Comparing the measured temperature (`TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_MES`) against the model-predicted temperature (`TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_MDL`) to detect significant deviations.
        *   **Range Check:** Ensuring the measured temperature is within predefined physical or operational limits.
        *   **Stability/Dynamics:** Monitoring the rate of change and stability of the temperature signal (e.g., using `TEMP_DIF` and `TEMP_STAB` outputs). This could involve detecting implausible rapid changes or prolonged stagnation.
        *   **System Context:** Incorporating other system states (`LV_CON_VB_OBD2`, `LV_IGKON`, etc.) to qualify the plausibility checks. For example, a fault might be inhibited if the engine is off or in a specific diagnostic mode.

5.  **Output Generation and Reporting (V.6.5):**
    *   The `OPM_1S` block produces a comprehensive set of diagnostic parameters, counters, and flags. These are then bundled into a data structure by the `V.6.5` block (likely a bus creator or structure pack).
    *   The most critical output, `<LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS>`, is explicitly routed out as the final diagnostic status, indicating whether the air temperature sensor is deemed plausible or if a fault is detected. The other outputs provide detailed information about the nature of any detected plausibility issues (e.g., stability problems, specific temperature differences).

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink-like diagram is to determine the activation state of an "Air Temperature Sensor Plausibility Diagnosis" (AIRT). It evaluates a set of preconditions and inhibitions to decide whether the plausibility check for the air temperature sensor should be actively running. Essentially, it computes a boolean flag that signals when it is appropriate to perform the sensor's plausibility diagnosis.

## Inputs
The system takes the following boolean or logical signals as inputs:
*   **`<LV_IGK>`**: Ignition Key status (e.g., TRUE if ignition is ON).
*   **`<LV_ST_END>`**: Engine Start-End status (e.g., TRUE if the engine cranking has finished and the engine is running).
*   **`<LV_CDN_VB_OBD2>`**: OBD2 Voltage/Condition status (e.g., TRUE if OBD2 relevant voltage conditions are met and stable).
*   **`<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_I>`**: Inhibit due to Error in Air Temperature Plausibility (e.g., TRUE if a current internal error state should prevent further diagnosis).
*   **`<LV_STATE_TLTS_MES_UP_I>`**: Air Temperature Sensor Measurement Up status (e.g., TRUE if the sensor measurement is available, valid, and initialized).
*   **`<LV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_CLR_DIAG>`**: Air Temperature Plausibility Clear Diagnosis request (e.g., TRUE if there is an ongoing request to clear the diagnosis results).

## Outputs
The system produces a single boolean output:
*   **`<LV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_ACT>`**: Air Temperature Sensor Plausibility Diagnosis Activation (TRUE if the diagnosis should be active, FALSE otherwise).

## Logic Flow
The logic flow determines the activation status by combining multiple conditions using NOT and AND gates:

1.  **Inhibition Condition Negation (First NOT Gate):** The input signal `<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_I>` (Inhibit Error) is passed through a NOT gate.
    *   If `<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_I>` is TRUE (diagnosis is inhibited by an error), the output of this NOT gate is FALSE.
    *   If `<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_I>` is FALSE (diagnosis is *not* inhibited), the output of this NOT gate is TRUE.
    This effectively checks that there is *no* active error inhibiting the diagnosis.

2.  **Clear Diagnosis Request Negation (Second NOT Gate):** The input signal `<LV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_CLR_DIAG>` (Clear Diagnosis Request) is passed through a second NOT gate.
    *   If `<LV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_CLR_DIAG>` is TRUE (a request to clear the diagnosis is active), the output of this NOT gate is FALSE.
    *   If `<LV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_CLR_DIAG>` is FALSE (no clear request is active), the output of this NOT gate is TRUE.
    This ensures that the diagnosis is not activated while a clear request is pending.

3.  **Final Activation Condition (AND Gate):** An AND gate receives six input signals, and its output, `<LV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_ACT>`, will be TRUE only if all six inputs to the AND gate are simultaneously TRUE. These inputs are:
    *   `<LV_IGK>` (Ignition is ON)
    *   `<LV_ST_END>` (Engine start sequence is complete / engine is running)
    *   `<LV_CDN_VB_OBD2>` (OBD2 conditions/voltage are valid)
    *   The output of the first NOT gate (meaning `<LV_INH_ERR_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_I>` is FALSE, i.e., diagnosis is *not* inhibited)
    *   `<LV_STATE_TLTS_MES_UP_I>` (Air temperature sensor measurement is available and valid)
    *   The output of the second NOT gate (meaning `<LV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_CLR_DIAG>` is FALSE, i.e., there is *no* pending clear diagnosis request)

In summary, the air temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis is activated (`<LV_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_ACT>` is TRUE) if and only if the ignition is on, the engine is running (or has finished starting), OBD2 conditions are met, there are no inhibiting errors, the sensor's measurement is available, and no request to clear the diagnosis is active.

This image displays two interconnected Simulink diagrams, which collectively perform an "Air temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis."

## Function

The primary function of this system is to continuously monitor an air temperature measurement, assess its stability over a "trailing" window (a series of recent measurements), and determine a specific "state" indicating the plausibility of the air temperature sensor's readings. It tracks the maximum and minimum temperatures within this window, calculates their difference, and increments a stability counter. Based on these calculated values, it outputs a stability state.

## Inputs

The system primarily takes the current air temperature measurement and several configuration constants as inputs. It also uses its own previous outputs as implicit inputs (feedback loops) to maintain state over time.

*   `<TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_MES>`: The current measured air temperature value for plausibility checking.
*   `C_TEMP_STAB_DIF_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`: A constant threshold value for the maximum allowable temperature difference.
*   `C_CTR_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`: A constant threshold value for the stability counter.
*   *(Implicit inputs from previous time step for internal state/feedback):*
    *   `<TEMP_STAB_MAX_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`: The maximum temperature recorded in the previous trailing window.
    *   `<TEMP_STAB_MIN_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`: The minimum temperature recorded in the previous trailing window.
    *   `<CTR_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`: The stability counter value from the previous time step.
    *   `<STATE_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i>`: The stability state determined in the previous time step.

## Outputs

The system produces several calculated values related to the temperature stability and a final stability state. These `_tmp_i` outputs typically represent internal states that are updated each time step.

*   `<TEMP_STAB_MAX_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`: The updated maximum temperature observed in the current trailing window.
*   `<TEMP_STAB_DIF_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`: The calculated temperature difference (Max - Min) for the current trailing window.
*   `<TEMP_STAB_MIN_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`: The updated minimum temperature observed in the current trailing window.
*   `<CTR_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`: The incremented stability counter value.
*   `<STATE_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i>`: The determined stability state of the air temperature sensor (e.g., 0 for stable, 1 for unstable due to high difference, previous state otherwise).

## Logic Flow

The system operates in two main stages, corresponding to the two figures:

### Stage 1: Calculation of Trailing Pointers and Counter (Figure 3.22.5)

This stage calculates the dynamic range and an incrementing counter based on the current temperature measurement.

1.  **Temperature Range Tracking:**
    *   The current measured air temperature (`<TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_MES>`) is fed into both a `max` block and a `min` block.
    *   The `max` block compares the current measured temperature with the previously stored maximum (`<TEMP_STAB_MAX_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`). It outputs the greater of the two as the new `TEMP_STAB_MAX_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i`.
    *   The `min` block compares the current measured temperature with the previously stored minimum (`<TEMP_STAB_MIN_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`). It outputs the lesser of the two as the new `TEMP_STAB_MIN_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i`.
2.  **Temperature Difference Calculation:**
    *   The newly calculated maximum temperature is then subtracted from the newly calculated minimum temperature using a `sum` block configured for subtraction (indicated by `+` and `-` inputs). The result is the current temperature difference, output as `<TEMP_STAB_DIF_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`.
3.  **Stability Counter Increment:**
    *   The previous stability counter value (`<CTR_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`) is fed into a `sum` block where it is incremented by `1` (from a constant `1` input). The result is the new stability counter value, output as `<CTR_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`.

### Stage 2: Calculation of the State of the Stability Check (Figure 3.22.6)

This stage uses the calculated temperature difference and stability counter, along with feedback from its own previous state, to determine the current stability state.

1.  **Check for High Temperature Difference:**
    *   The calculated temperature difference (`<TEMP_STAB_DIF_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`) is compared to a constant threshold (`C_TEMP_STAB_DIF_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`) using a "Greater than or equal to" (`>=`) relational block.
    *   This comparison result controls the first `If` block:
        *   **If TRUE (Temperature difference is too high):** The output state is set to `1`. This is achieved by taking a constant `2` and subtracting `1` (implicitly or from a connected input to the subtract block) resulting in `1`. This state (e.g., `1`) likely signifies an "unstable" condition due to excessive temperature variation.
        *   **If FALSE (Temperature difference is acceptable):** The control flow moves to the `else` path, which contains a nested `If-Else` block to check the stability counter.
2.  **Check for Stability Counter Threshold:**
    *   Within the `else` path of the first `If` block, the incremented stability counter (`<CTR_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_tmp_i>`) is compared to its constant threshold (`C_CTR_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS`) using another "Greater than or equal to" (`>=`) block.
    *   This comparison result controls the second `If` block:
        *   **If TRUE (Stability counter has reached its threshold):** The output state is set to `0`. This is achieved by taking a constant `1` and subtracting `1` (implicitly or from a connected input) resulting in `0`. This state (e.g., `0`) likely signifies a "stable" or "plausible" condition, as the temperature difference has been acceptable for a sufficient number of cycles.
        *   **If FALSE (Stability counter is still below threshold):** The output state is retained from the previous time step (`<STATE_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i>`, fed back into the subsystem). This implies the system is still gathering data or waiting for conditions to stabilize further.
3.  **Merge and Output State:**
    *   A `Merge` block combines the results from the various conditional branches into a single output signal. This final value represents the current stability state and is output as `<STATE_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i>`, which also feeds back into the subsystem for the next time step.

This image contains two distinct Simulink diagrams related to an Air Temperature Sensor Plausibility Diagnosis. I will analyze both to provide a complete understanding of the system's function.

## Function
The primary function of this system is to manage the operational state and associated variables for an Air Temperature Sensor Plausibility Diagnosis (AIRT).
1.  **Diagnosis State Calculation (Figure 3.22.10):** It determines whether the air temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis is currently active or enabled based on several input conditions.
2.  **Variable Reset (Figure 3.22.11):** When the diagnosis is deemed inactive, it resets various internal diagnostic variables and counters to their default or initial states, preparing the system for the next diagnostic cycle.

## Inputs
**Common/System Inputs:**
*   `phys_max`: A constant representing the physical maximum possible air temperature value, used for initialization.
*   `phys_min`: A constant representing the physical minimum possible air temperature value, used for initialization.

**Inputs for Diagnosis State Calculation (Figure 3.22.10):**
*   `clc_sym_hot_check`: A boolean signal indicating a specific "hot check" or symbolic condition relevant to diagnosis activation.
*   `LV_TEMP_DIF_THD_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: An integer or boolean signal representing a local variable related to a temperature difference threshold for air plausibility.
*   `LV_CDN_DIAG_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: An integer or boolean signal representing the local variable for the main diagnostic activation condition for air plausibility.

**Inputs for Variable Reset (Figure 3.22.11):**
*   (Implicit) The condition `LV_CDN_DIAG_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i = 0` triggers this reset logic.
*   Constant '0' values: Used for resetting various counters and flags to zero.

## Outputs
**Output from Diagnosis State Calculation (Figure 3.22.10):**
*   `LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_b`: A boolean signal indicating the calculated Local Fault State for Diagnosis On/Off (DGO) related to the Air Temperature Sensor Plausibility (TLTS_AIR_PLAUS). 'True' typically means the diagnosis is active, 'False' means it's inactive.

**Variables being reset (effectively outputs of the reset action, Figure 3.22.11):**
These are internal diagnostic variables whose values are modified by the reset logic.
*   `TEMP_STAB_MIN_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: The stored minimum temperature for stability checks.
*   `TEMP_STAB_MAX_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: The stored maximum temperature for stability checks.
*   `TEMP_STAB_DIF_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: The calculated temperature stability difference.
*   `CTR_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: A counter related to temperature stability.
*   `STATE_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: A state variable indicating the current temperature stability state.
*   `CTR_SYM_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: A counter related to symmetry checks.
*   `LV_TEMP_DIF_THD_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: Local variable for temperature difference threshold.
*   `LV_CDN_DIAG_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: Local variable for the main diagnostic condition.
*   `LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: Local variable for the fault state of diagnosis on/off.

## Logic Flow

The system's logic flows through two main stages:

### 1. Calculation of the State of the Diagnosis (Figure 3.22.10)
This diagram implements the logic to determine if the air temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis should be active.
*   **Step 1: Input Evaluation:** Three main inputs are considered:
    *   `clc_sym_hot_check`: This signal is directly fed into the logical combination.
    *   `LV_TEMP_DIF_THD_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: This signal passes through a "Check ~= 0" block, which converts it into a boolean `true` if its value is not zero, and `false` if it is zero.
    *   `LV_CDN_DIAG_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`: This signal also passes through a "Check ~= 0" block, converting it to a boolean `true` if not zero, `false` if zero.
*   **Step 2: Logical Combination:** The processed inputs (the `clc_sym_hot_check` and the boolean results from the "Check ~= 0" blocks for `LV_TEMP_DIF_THD_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i` and `LV_CDN_DIAG_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`) are fed into a series of implied logical operations. The exact logical gates (e.g., AND, OR) are not explicitly labeled but are performed by the converging signal paths and internal blocks labeled '3', '1', '0'. These likely represent a specific truth table or nested conditional logic.
*   **Step 3: Output Generation:** The final boolean result of this logical combination is assigned to the `LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_b` output, indicating whether the air temperature plausibility diagnosis is currently active (`true`) or inactive (`false`).

### 2. Reset of Variables at Activation Condition Off (Figure 3.22.11)
This diagram describes the actions taken when the air temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis is inactive, as stated by the condition: `LV_CDN_DIAG_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS = 0`. This logic is encapsulated within the `clc_cdn_off` block, which is likely an atomic subsystem or function-call subsystem that executes when the reset condition is met.
*   **Step 1: Initializing Minimum/Maximum Stability Temperatures:**
    *   The `TEMP_STAB_MIN_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i` variable is reset by assigning it the `phys_max` value. This is a common initialization strategy to ensure that any subsequently measured temperature will be correctly captured as the "new minimum".
    *   The `TEMP_STAB_MAX_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i` variable is reset by assigning it the `phys_min` value. Similarly, this ensures any subsequent measurement is captured as the "new maximum".
*   **Step 2: Resetting Counters and Flags to Zero:** All other listed diagnostic variables and counters, including `TEMP_STAB_DIF_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`, `CTR_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`, `STATE_STAB_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`, `CTR_SYM_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`, `LV_TEMP_DIF_THD_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`, `LV_CDN_DIAG_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`, and `LF_STATE_DGO_TLTS_AIR_PLAUS_i`, are reset to a constant value of '0'. These are assigned from constant '0' blocks.
*   **Step 3: Execution via Subsystem:** All these reset assignments are fed as inputs into the `clc_cdn_off` block, which performs the actual write operations to update the internal states of these variables, effectively clearing or initializing them for the next active diagnostic cycle.

This image displays a Simulink-like block diagram, which is commonly used in automotive embedded software development for modeling control systems and diagnostic functions. The title "AIRT. Intake gas temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis" clearly indicates its purpose.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to perform a plausibility diagnosis for the Intake Gas Temperature (TIG) sensor. This involves checking if the sensor readings are logical, within expected ranges, and behaving dynamically as anticipated. The module aims to detect sensor failures such as being stuck at a value, reporting implausible rates of change, or giving overall unreliable readings.

## Inputs
The diagram receives several inputs, which can be categorized as control signals, activation flags, raw sensor data, and configuration parameters:

*   **`_LV_IGK`**: Ignition key status, used for module activation.
*   **`_BEST_DC>`**: Best diagnostic status, likely a general diagnostic condition flag.
*   **`_LV_CDN_VB_OBD2>`**: Control signal for OBD2 voltage diagnosis.
*   **`_LV_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_ACT>`**: Activation flag for dynamic TIG plausibility check.
*   **`_LV_ENF_TIG_PLAUS>`**: Overall enable flag for TIG plausibility.
*   **`_LV_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_ACT>`**: Activation flag for stuck TIG plausibility check.
*   **`_LV_ST_END>`**: Status end, possibly related to engine stop or ignition off.
*   **`_LV_TIG_PLAUS_CDN_DIAG>`**: TIG plausibility condition for diagnosis.
*   **`_LV_T_ER_DE_W_FI>`**: Error flag related to temperature or fuel injection.
*   **`_LV_T_IS_NOT_AVG_AIBT>`**: Flag indicating intake air temperature is not averaged.
*   **`_MIN_MAX_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>`**: Configuration parameter for stuck TIG plausibility limits.
*   **`_MIN_MAX_INC_TIG_PLAUS>`**: Configuration parameter for increasing TIG plausibility limits.
*   **`_LV_NO_PLAUS_COND>`**: Flag indicating no plausibility condition is met.
*   **`_RATE_HEAT_UP_ER_DC>`**: Rate of heat-up error diagnostic condition.
*   **`_STATE_HEAT_UP_PLAUS_R>`**: Reference state for heat-up plausibility.
*   **`_TAIR>`**: Intake air temperature (likely raw sensor data or a pre-processed value).
*   **`_TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV>`**: Temperature of a hot source, potentially for rationality checks.
*   **`_TIG_PLAUS_MEAS>`**: The primary measured intake gas temperature to be diagnosed.
*   **`_ST_AST_DC>`**: Start/stop diagnostic condition.
*   **`_TLSS_GD>`**: Throttle less good condition.
*   **`TIG_MIN(MAX)_DYN_TIG_PLAUS`**: Initialization/configuration parameters for dynamic TIG plausibility (min/max).
*   **`TIG_MIN(MAX)_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS`**: Initialization/configuration parameters for stuck TIG plausibility (min/max).

## Outputs
The module provides diagnostic states as its primary outputs, indicating the health and plausibility of the TIG sensor:

*   **`_LF_STATE_DGO_DYN_TIG_PLAUS>`**: The diagnostic state resulting from the dynamic plausibility check of the TIG sensor.
*   **`_LF_STATE_DGO_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>`**: The diagnostic state resulting from the stuck sensor plausibility check of the TIG sensor.
*   **`_LF_STATE_DGO_TIG_PLAUS>`**: The overall, aggregated diagnostic state of the TIG sensor plausibility.

Additionally, the `V.6.7` display block shows numerous internal variables which are intermediate outputs and states used within the plausibility logic, such as `LF_STATE_DGO_TIG_PLAUS`, `TIG_DIF_DYN_TIG_PLAUS`, `T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS`, etc.

## Logic Flow

1.  **Task Scheduling and Activation (`fc_tg_pla` block):**
    *   The entire plausibility diagnosis module (`fc_tg_pla`) is scheduled to execute with a recurrence of `1S` (every 1 second).
    *   It is initialized upon `RST` (Reset), `IGKON` (Ignition ON), `NVMINI` (Non-Volatile Memory Initialization), and `NVMSTO` (Non-Volatile Memory Store).
    *   The module is activated by the `_LV_IGK` (Ignition Key) signal. It is designed to run continuously once activated (`Deactivation: never`). This block acts as the scheduler/trigger for the core logic.

2.  **Initialization (`3.25.1 Initialization at IGKON and RST` text):**
    *   Upon `IGKON` or `RST`, all internal variables are initialized to zero.
    *   Crucially, "trailing pointers" for dynamic and stuck TIG plausibility (`TIG_MIN(MAX)_DYN_TIG_PLAUS` and `TIG_MIN(MAX)_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS`) are initialized with `min = phys_max` and `max = phys_min`. This ensures that the system correctly tracks the actual physical min/max values of the sensor readings from the start of operation, allowing for accurate detection of out-of-range or stuck conditions.

3.  **Core Plausibility Logic (`OPM_1S` subsystem):**
    *   The `fc_tg_pla` block calls the `OPM_1S` (X.2) subsystem, passing all relevant input signals as a bundled input (`input`). There's also a `feedback` input, suggesting that some internal states or calculated values from the previous execution cycle are fed back into the current cycle, which is common for filtering, tracking, or state machine logic.
    *   The `opm_100ms` annotation within `OPM_1S` hints that the 1-second task might orchestrate or call a faster internal 100ms sub-component for more granular processing.
    *   Within `OPM_1S`, the following types of plausibility checks are performed:
        *   **Dynamic Plausibility:** If `_LV_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_ACT` is active, the rate of change of `_TIG_PLAUS_MEAS` is monitored. If the rate exceeds configured limits (`TIG_MIN(MAX)_DYN_TIG_PLAUS`), a dynamic plausibility error (`_LF_STATE_DGO_DYN_TIG_PLAUS`) is flagged.
        *   **Stuck Plausibility:** If `_LV_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_ACT` is active, the `_TIG_PLAUS_MEAS` signal is checked to see if it remains constant for an extended period, violating the configured limits (`TIG_MIN(MAX)_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS`). If so, a stuck sensor error (`_LF_STATE_DGO_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS`) is flagged.
        *   **Rationality/Static Plausibility:** Implicitly, `OPM_1S` would also perform checks like:
            *   **Range Checks:** Ensure `_TIG_PLAUS_MEAS` is within physically possible or defined operating limits.
            *   **Comparison Checks:** Potentially compare `_TIG_PLAUS_MEAS` with other temperature sources like `_TEMP_HOT_SRC_MMV` or `_TAIR` under specific conditions to ensure rationality.
            *   **Condition-Based Checks:** Use flags like `_BEST_DC>`, `_LV_TIG_PLAUS_CDN_DIAG`, `_LV_NO_PLAUS_COND` to enable/disable or modify the plausibility logic based on current system conditions.

4.  **Output Generation:**
    *   The results of these individual plausibility checks are processed and consolidated.
    *   The final aggregated state of TIG sensor plausibility is output as `_LF_STATE_DGO_TIG_PLAUS`. This output represents the overall assessment of the sensor's trustworthiness.
    *   The individual states for dynamic and stuck plausibility are also output separately for detailed diagnosis.
    *   Intermediate variables and states are made available (as shown in the `V.6.7` block) for debugging or further module integration.

This image contains a Simulink-style block diagram (Figure 3.25:4) for an automotive diagnostic function.

## Function

The primary function of this Simulink diagram (Figure 3.25:4, titled "AIRT. Intake gas temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis") is to perform a plausibility check on an intake gas temperature (TIG) sensor, specifically to detect if the sensor is "stuck" or reporting implausible values. It evaluates the measured temperature against static maximum/minimum limits and checks for sufficient dynamic change (i.e., if the temperature signal is varying as expected). Based on these checks and an enabling condition, it generates a temporary symptom flag.

## Inputs

1.  **`<TIG_MAX_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>`**: A calibrated threshold representing the maximum permissible intake gas temperature for the stuck sensor diagnosis.
2.  **`<TIG_PLAUS_MES>`**: The measured intake gas temperature value from the sensor.
3.  **`<TIG_MIN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>`**: A calibrated threshold representing the minimum permissible intake gas temperature for the stuck sensor diagnosis.
4.  **`C_TIG_DIF_THD_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS`**: A calibrated threshold for the minimum allowed difference between the maximum and minimum measured intake gas temperature over a period, used to detect if the sensor is "stuck" (not changing).
5.  **`<LV_CDN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>`**: A boolean signal indicating if the conditions for running the TIG stuck plausibility diagnosis are currently met (e.g., engine running, ambient temperature stable).

## Outputs

1.  **`<TIG_MAX_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_IS>`**: A boolean flag that is true if the measured intake gas temperature (`<TIG_PLAUS_MES>`) exceeds the maximum permissible limit (`<TIG_MAX_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>`).
2.  **`<TIG_DIF_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_IS>`**: A boolean flag that is true if the difference between the maximum and minimum measured intake gas temperature (over a defined window) is less than the differential threshold (`C_TIG_DIF_THD_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS`). This indicates a potential "stuck" sensor.
3.  **`<TIG_MIN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_IS>`**: A boolean flag that is true if the measured intake gas temperature (`<TIG_PLAUS_MES>`) falls below the minimum permissible limit (`<TIG_MIN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>`).
4.  **`<LV_SYM_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_TMP>`**: A temporary boolean symptom flag. It becomes true if any of the plausibility checks fail, subject to a debouncing or fault confirmation logic, and only when the diagnosis is enabled (`<LV_CDN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>` is true). This signal is likely an input to a subsequent fault management stage (as seen in Figure 3.25:5).

## Logic Flow

The diagram processes the intake gas temperature sensor reading (`<TIG_PLAUS_MES>`) through three parallel plausibility checks:

1.  **Maximum Limit Check:**
    *   The `TIG_PLAUS_MES` is compared with `<TIG_MAX_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>` using a "greater than" (`>`) comparator.
    *   If `TIG_PLAUS_MES` > `TIG_MAX_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS`, the output `<TIG_MAX_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_IS>` becomes true.

2.  **Minimum Limit Check:**
    *   The `TIG_PLAUS_MES` is compared with `<TIG_MIN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>` using a "less than" (`<`) comparator.
    *   If `TIG_PLAUS_MES` < `TIG_MIN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS`, the output `<TIG_MIN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_IS>` becomes true.

3.  **Dynamic/Differential Check for "Stuck" Condition:**
    *   A `max` block continuously tracks the maximum value of `TIG_PLAUS_MES` over a defined period (or window).
    *   A `min` block continuously tracks the minimum value of `TIG_PLAUS_MES` over the same period.
    *   The output of the `max` block is subtracted from the output of the `min` block using a `+ / -` sum block (configured as subtraction: max - min). This calculates the variation in temperature.
    *   The calculated temperature variation is then compared with `C_TIG_DIF_THD_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS` using a "less than" (`<`) comparator.
    *   If (max `TIG_PLAUS_MES` - min `TIG_PLAUS_MES`) < `C_TIG_DIF_THD_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS`, the output `<TIG_DIF_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_IS>` becomes true, indicating insufficient temperature change (a "stuck" sensor).

4.  **Symptom Generation and Debouncing:**
    *   The boolean outputs of the three plausibility checks (`<TIG_MAX_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_IS>`, `<TIG_DIF_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_IS>`, `<TIG_MIN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_IS>`) are combined using an implied OR logic (represented by the merging lines). This means if *any* of the three checks indicate an error, a raw plausibility fault condition is present.
    *   This raw fault condition is then fed into a "Check ~= 0" block along with the `<LV_CDN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>` diagnosis enable signal. This block typically functions as an up/down counter or a debouncing element.
        *   If the raw fault condition is true *and* `<LV_CDN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>` is true, an internal counter increments. If this counter reaches a threshold of '3' (indicated on the block), the output `<LV_SYM_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_TMP>` is set to true.
        *   If the raw fault condition is false *and* `<LV_CDN_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS>` is true, the internal counter decrements. If it falls below a threshold of '1' (indicated on the block), the output `<LV_SYM_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_TMP>` is reset to false.
        *   This debouncing mechanism ensures that transient sensor anomalies do not immediately trigger a symptom, and the symptom is only set after a sustained fault condition.

In essence, the diagram determines if the intake gas temperature sensor is reporting logically impossible values (too high/low) or is static when it should be dynamic, and then confirms this condition over time before asserting a temporary diagnostic symptom.


--- Page 153 ---

This image is a Simulink diagram, or a diagram from a similar model-based design environment, depicting a control logic.

## Function
The primary function of this Simulink diagram is to calculate a dynamic plausibility symptom and update related states for a component, likely an intake gas temperature (TIG) sensor, as part of an automotive diagnostic system. It evaluates specific conditions based on dynamic temperature changes and thresholds to determine if a temporary fault symptom should be set, and to manage associated internal states and diagnostic flags. The overall logic is designed to detect abnormal dynamic behavior, such as excessively fast temperature increments or decrements, or if a dynamic temperature difference falls below a threshold.

## Inputs
1.  **`STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_cur_i`**: Current state of the dynamic plausibility for the TIG sensor. This is likely an enumerated or integer value (e.g., 1 or 2).
2.  **`T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`**: A dynamic value representing the TIG sensor's behavior, possibly a calculated rate of change or a difference.
3.  **`C_TIG_DYN_INC_MAX`**: A constant threshold representing the maximum allowed dynamic increment for `T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`.
4.  **`C_TIG_DYN_DEC_MAX`**: A constant threshold representing the maximum allowed dynamic decrement for `T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`.
5.  **`TIG_DIF_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`**: A dynamic difference value for TIG plausibility.
6.  **`TIG_DIF_THD_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`**: A threshold for the dynamic difference `TIG_DIF_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`.
7.  **`LV_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_TMP_old_i`**: The temporary dynamic plausibility symptom from the previous time step (lagged value).
8.  **`LV_CLC_DIAG_Imp_i`**: A diagnostic impulse or flag, likely used for resetting or triggering diagnostic sequences.

## Outputs
1.  **`LV_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_TMP_i`**: The calculated temporary dynamic plausibility symptom for the current time step. This is stored in a data store and also outputted.
2.  **`STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`**: The updated state of the dynamic plausibility for the TIG sensor. This is stored in a data store and also outputted.
3.  **`LV_CLC_DIAG_Imp_i`**: The updated diagnostic impulse or flag. This is stored in a data store and also outputted.

## Logic Flow

The diagram calculates the temporary symptom and updates states in a sequential, sample-time based manner, typical for embedded control systems. The blocks represented by `-.-.` are Unit Delay or Memory blocks, holding values from the previous time step.

1.  **Increment Plausibility Check (Upper Branch):**
    *   The current state `STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_cur_i` is checked if it equals '2'.
    *   Simultaneously, `T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i` is compared to `C_TIG_DYN_INC_MAX` to see if it's greater than or equal to the maximum increment threshold.
    *   These two boolean conditions are combined using an `AND` gate. If both are true, it indicates a potential "increment fault" condition (`u1`).

2.  **Decrement Plausibility Check (Middle-Upper Branch):**
    *   The current state `STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_cur_i` is checked if it equals '1'.
    *   Simultaneously, `T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i` is compared to `C_TIG_DYN_DEC_MAX` to see if it's less than or equal to the maximum decrement threshold.
    *   These two boolean conditions are combined using another `AND` gate. If both are true, it indicates a potential "decrement fault" condition (`u2`).

3.  **Conditional State/Symptom Selection:**
    *   An `if-else-if` type block (labeled `if(u1) else if(u2) else(etac)`) uses the `u1` and `u2` conditions to select one of three output paths:
        *   If `u1` (increment fault) is true, a specific value/signal is selected.
        *   Else if `u2` (decrement fault) is true, another specific value/signal is selected.
        *   Else (`etac`), a default value/signal is selected.
    *   These three selected signals are then passed through individual Unit Delay blocks (labeled `-.-.`). This means the values considered for the next stage are the results from the *previous* sample time.

4.  **Dynamic Difference Plausibility Check (Middle-Lower Branch):**
    *   `TIG_DIF_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i` (dynamic difference) is compared to `TIG_DIF_THD_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i` (difference threshold) to see if it is less than the threshold.
    *   The boolean result of this comparison (`V.6.4`) controls a `Switch` block.
    *   If the condition is true, the `Switch` outputs '1'; otherwise, it outputs '0'.
    *   This output is also passed through a Unit Delay block (`-.-.`), providing its previous value to the next stage.

5.  **Bus Merging:**
    *   The four delayed outputs from the plausibility checks (three from the conditional selector, one from the dynamic difference check) are combined into a single `BusMerge` block. This bus aggregates the results of the various plausibility evaluations.

6.  **Final Symptom and State Generation (Lower Branch and Outputs):**
    *   The `BusMerge` output, along with the previous temporary symptom (`LV_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_TMP_old_i` passed through a Unit Delay), and the diagnostic impulse (`LV_CLC_DIAG_Imp_i`, potentially reset by '0' via another Unit Delay) are fed into a final logic block (implicitly represented by the connections to the output ports).
    *   This final logic determines the current values of:
        *   **`LV_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_TMP_i`**: The temporary symptom, possibly derived from the bus and previous symptom.
        *   **`STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`**: The updated dynamic plausibility state, likely updated based on the bus content and previous state.
        *   **`LV_CLC_DIAG_Imp_i`**: The updated diagnostic impulse, potentially incremented or reset based on fault conditions and external triggers.
    *   These three final outputs are made available as output ports of the subsystem and are also written to global data stores (indicated by the `->` blocks with names).

The overall logic implies a state machine that updates its state and sets a temporary symptom based on various dynamic conditions of the TIG sensor, with consideration for previous states/symptoms to enable cumulative fault detection (e.g., counting consecutive occurrences as mentioned in the accompanying text).

This image contains two distinct Simulink-style diagrams, each defining a specific part of an automotive diagnostic system, likely related to Intake Gas Temperature (TIG) sensor plausibility.

## Function

The image presents two sub-systems:

1.  **Figure 3.25.10: Error definition for DYN part of TIG_PLAUS diagnosis**
    *   **Primary Function:** This diagram is responsible for calculating a dynamic plausibility counter and a corresponding diagnostic state flag. It monitors the consistency of a temporary dynamic plausibility symbol and increments a counter if the symbol remains stable. Based on this counter and an activation condition, it determines the diagnostic state.

2.  **Figure 3.25.11: Reinitialization of variables at state change**
    *   **Primary Function:** This diagram manages the reinitialization and continuous tracking of minimum, maximum, and time variables related to the dynamic TIG plausibility. When a change in the dynamic plausibility state is detected, these variables are reset; otherwise, they are updated based on the current measured value.

## Inputs

**For Figure 3.25.11 (Reinitialization):**

*   `TIG_PLAUS_MES_i`: Current measured Intake Gas Temperature Plausibility value.
*   `STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_cur_i`: Current dynamic plausibility state.
*   `STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i`: Previous dynamic plausibility state.
*   `TIG_MIN_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i`: Previous minimum dynamic TIG plausibility value.
*   `TIG_MAX_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i`: Previous maximum dynamic TIG plausibility value.
*   `T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_tmp_i`: Temporary dynamic TIG plausibility time (likely representing an incremented timer value).

## Outputs

*   `TIG_MAX_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`: Current maximum dynamic TIG plausibility value.
*   `T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`: Current dynamic TIG plausibility time.

## Logic Flow

### Figure 3.25.10: Error definition for DYN part of TIG_PLAUS diagnosis

1.  **Check for temporary plausibility symbol stability:**
    *   The `LV_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_TMP_i` (current symbol) is compared with `LV_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_TMP_old_i` (previous symbol) using an equality operator (V.6.5).
    *   If they are equal (symbol is stable), the output is `1` (true); otherwise, `0` (false).

2.  **Dynamic Plausibility Counter (`CTR_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`) Calculation:**
    *   **Increment Logic:** If the temporary plausibility symbol is stable (`LV_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_TMP_i == LV_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_TMP_old_i`), the `CTR_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i` is incremented by `1`. If not stable, the value is `0`.
    *   **Activation Control:** This calculated value is then passed through a Switch block (V.6.9) controlled by `LV_CLC_DIAG_tmp_i`.
        *   If `LV_CLC_DIAG_tmp_i` is true (non-zero), the incremented/reset counter value is selected.
        *   If `LV_CLC_DIAG_tmp_i` is false (zero), the `CTR_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i` value is selected (meaning the counter holds its previous value if diagnosis is inactive).
    *   The final output of this path is `CTR_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`.

3.  **Diagnostic State Flag (`LF_STATE_DGO_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`) Calculation:**
    *   **Threshold Check:** The `CTR_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i` is compared with a constant threshold `C_CTR_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS` using a "greater than or equal to" operator (V.6.5).
    *   **State Assignment:**
        *   If `CTR_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i >= C_CTR_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS` (threshold reached), an intermediate value of `3` is selected.
        *   Otherwise (threshold not reached), an intermediate value of `1` is selected.
    *   **Activation Control:** This intermediate value is passed through a Switch block (V.6.9) controlled by `LV_CLC_DIAG_tmp_i`.
        *   If `LV_CLC_DIAG_tmp_i` is true (non-zero), the assigned state (3 or 1) is selected.
        *   If `LV_CLC_DIAG_tmp_i` is false (zero), a value of `0` is selected (indicating an inactive diagnostic state).
    *   The final output of this path is `LF_STATE_DGO_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`.

### Figure 3.25.11: Reinitialization of variables at state change

1.  **Detect State Change:**
    *   `STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_cur_i` (current state) is compared with `STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i` (previous state) using an inequality operator (`!=`, V.6.5).
    *   If they are different (state change), the output `isStateChanged` is `1` (true); otherwise, `0` (false). This signal acts as the control for subsequent Switch blocks.

2.  **Minimum Plausibility Value (`TIG_MIN_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`) Logic:**
    *   **Reinitialization/Tracking Input:** A Switch block (V.6.9) uses `isStateChanged` as its control.
        *   If `isStateChanged` is true: `TIG_PLAUS_MES_i` (current measured value) is selected.
        *   If `isStateChanged` is false: `TIG_MIN_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i` (previous minimum) is selected.
    *   **Update Logic:** This selected value, along with the continuously fed `TIG_PLAUS_MES_i`, is passed into a Min-selector block (labeled `<TIG_MIN_DYN_TIG_PLAUS>`).
        *   If `isStateChanged` is true: `TIG_MIN_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i` becomes `min(TIG_PLAUS_MES_i, TIG_PLAUS_MES_i)`, effectively reinitializing it to `TIG_PLAUS_MES_i`.
        *   If `isStateChanged` is false: `TIG_MIN_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i` becomes `min(TIG_PLAUS_MES_i, TIG_MIN_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i)`, continuously tracking the minimum.

3.  **Maximum Plausibility Value (`TIG_MAX_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`) Logic:**
    *   **Reinitialization/Tracking Input:** Similar to the minimum, a Switch block (V.6.9) uses `isStateChanged` as its control.
        *   If `isStateChanged` is true: `TIG_PLAUS_MES_i` is selected.
        *   If `isStateChanged` is false: `TIG_MAX_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i` is selected.
    *   **Update Logic:** This selected value, along with `TIG_PLAUS_MES_i`, is passed into a Max-selector block (labeled `<TIG_MAX_DYN_TIG_PLAUS>`).
        *   If `isStateChanged` is true: `TIG_MAX_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i` becomes `max(TIG_PLAUS_MES_i, TIG_PLAUS_MES_i)`, reinitializing it to `TIG_PLAUS_MES_i`.
        *   If `isStateChanged` is false: `TIG_MAX_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i` becomes `max(TIG_PLAUS_MES_i, TIG_MAX_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_old_i)`, continuously tracking the maximum.

4.  **Dynamic Plausibility Timer (`T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`) Logic:**
    *   A Switch block (V.6.9) uses `isStateChanged` as its control.
        *   If `isStateChanged` is true: The timer is reinitialized to `0`.
        *   If `isStateChanged` is false: `T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_tmp_i` (likely an incremented version of the previous timer value) is selected, allowing the timer to continue.
    *   The output of this switch is `T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i`.

This image contains two distinct Simulink-like diagrams related to the "Intake gas temperature sensor plausibility diagnosis" (AIRT). I will analyze both as parts of a larger diagnostic system.

## Function

The primary function of these Simulink diagrams is to perform a plausibility diagnosis for an intake gas temperature (TIG) sensor.
The first diagram (Figure 3.25.12) acts as an input aggregation and initialization block, gathering various physical limits, dynamic thresholds, and intermediate diagnostic flags.
The second diagram (Figure 3.25.13) defines the *final* error state for the TIG sensor plausibility (`TIG_PLAUS`) by logically combining the results of "STUCK" (static) and "DYN" (dynamic) sub-diagnoses, incorporating debouncing or state-holding logic.

## Inputs

**From Figure 3.25.12 (Initialization/Parameter Aggregation):**
*   **`phys_min`**: Physical minimum value for the temperature sensor (e.g., a calibration parameter).
*   **`TIG_MAX_DYN_TIG_PLAUS`**: Maximum dynamic threshold for intake gas temperature plausibility.
*   **`phys_max`**: Physical maximum value for the temperature sensor (e.g., a calibration parameter).
*   **`TIG_MIN_DYN_TIG_PLAUS`**: Minimum dynamic threshold for intake gas temperature plausibility.
*   **`<T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i>`**: An input signal representing a component of dynamic temperature plausibility.
*   **`<STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i>`**: An input signal representing a component of dynamic state plausibility.
*   **`<CTR_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i>`**: An input signal representing a component of dynamic counter/symmetry plausibility.
*   **`<LF_STATE_DGO_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i>`**: The Low-Frequency state for Dynamic TIG Plausibility diagnosis (an intermediate diagnostic result, also used in Figure 3.25.13).

**From Figure 3.25.13 (Final Error Definition):**
*   **`<LF_STATE_DGO_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i>`**: (As above) Low-Frequency state for Dynamic TIG Plausibility diagnosis.
*   **`<LF_STATE_DGO_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_i>`**: Low-Frequency state for Stuck (static) TIG Plausibility diagnosis (another intermediate diagnostic result).

## Outputs

**From Figure 3.25.12 (Initialization/Parameter Aggregation):**
*   **`init`**: A single output, likely a bus signal or an array, consolidating the various input parameters and intermediate states for further processing or initialization of the diagnostic system.

**From Figure 3.25.13 (Final Error Definition):**
*   **`<LF_STATE_DGO_TIG_PLAUS_o>`**: The final aggregated Low-Frequency state of the overall TIG sensor plausibility diagnosis. This signal indicates the confirmed diagnostic status (e.g., no fault, active fault, confirmed fault).

## Logic Flow

**Figure 3.25.12: Initialization and Parameter Aggregation**
1.  **Input Collection**: This block, labeled `f()`, receives multiple inputs: physical min/max temperature limits (`phys_min`, `phys_max`), dynamic plausibility thresholds (`TIG_MAX_DYN_TIG_PLAUS`, `TIG_MIN_DYN_TIG_PLAUS`), and several intermediate diagnostic signals related to dynamic plausibility (`<T_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i>`, `<STATE_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i>`, `<CTR_SYM_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i>`, `<LF_STATE_DGO_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i>`).
2.  **Consolidation**: The subsystem aggregates these diverse inputs. Given the single output port labeled `init`, it likely forms a bus signal or a structured array containing these values. This consolidated output would typically be used to initialize parameters, provide context for subsequent diagnostic logic, or pass a collection of current diagnostic states to other parts of the system.

**Figure 3.25.13: Final Error Definition for TIG_PLAUS Diagnosis**
This diagram defines the final overall plausibility state by combining results from two independent sub-diagnoses: Dynamic (DYN) and Stuck (STUCK) TIG plausibility.

1.  **Check for Confirmed Faults (Level 3 Error):**
    *   The `LF_STATE_DGO_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i` signal (dynamic plausibility state) is compared to the constant `3` using an equality (`==`) block. A value of `3` often signifies a confirmed fault or a severe error state in diagnostic systems.
    *   Similarly, the `LF_STATE_DGO_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_i` signal (stuck plausibility state) is compared to the constant `3`.
    *   The results of these two comparisons are fed into an `OR` block. If *either* the dynamic *or* the stuck diagnosis indicates a state of `3`, the `OR` block outputs `true`.
    *   This `true` output is then passed to a debouncing/state-holding block (labeled `f()` and `Check ~= 0` with input `3`). This block likely implements logic to ensure the fault persists for a certain duration or count before officially confirming it.

2.  **Check for Active Faults (Level > 0 Error):**
    *   The `LF_STATE_DGO_DYN_TIG_PLAUS_i` signal is checked if it is greater than (`>`) `0`. A value greater than `0` often signifies an active fault, even if not yet fully confirmed.
    *   The `LF_STATE_DGO_STUCK_TIG_PLAUS_i` signal is also checked if it is greater than (`>`) `0`.
    *   These two "greater than 0" comparisons are combined with another `OR` block. If *either* the dynamic *or* the stuck diagnosis indicates a state greater than `0`, the `OR` block outputs `true`.
    *   This `true` output is passed to another debouncing/state-holding block (labeled `f()` and `Check ~= 0` with input `0`). This block handles the persistence check for any active fault state.

3.  **Final Aggregation:**
    *   The outputs of both debouncing/state-holding blocks (one for confirmed faults `==3` and one for active faults `>0`) are implicitly combined within the final `f()` subsystem block (or with an implied OR gate before its output).
    *   The result of this final combination logic is output as `<LF_STATE_DGO_TIG_PLAUS_o>`, which represents the overall, debounced, and aggregated plausibility state of the intake gas temperature sensor diagnosis. This output will indicate a fault if either a confirmed fault condition or an active fault condition is met and sustained according to the debouncing logic.
