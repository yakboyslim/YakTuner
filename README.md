### Key Features

  * **Wastegate (WG) Tuning:** Analyzes WGDC and boost pressure to recommend adjustments to base tables, with support for both standard and SWG logic.
  * **Mass Airflow (MAF) Tuning:** Corrects MAF scaling based on short-term and long-term fuel trims.
  * **Multiplicative Fuel Factor (MFF) Tuning:** Adjusts MFF tables based on fuel trims.
  * **Ignition (KNK) Tuning:** Detects knock events across all cylinders and recommends ignition timing corrections for a selected base map.
  * **Low-Pressure Fuel Pump (LPFP) Tuning:** Analyzes LPFP duty cycle and pressure to recommend table adjustments.
  * **Interactive Log Variable Mapping:** A smart system that automatically finds the data it needs from your logs. If it's unsure about a variable, it will simply ask you to match it to the correct column from your log file.
  * **Built-in Error Reporting:** If the app encounters a problem, you can easily send a report directly to the developer to help improve the tool.

### How to Use

Follow these steps to get your recommended tune adjustments.

**1. Configure Settings (Sidebar)**

On the left side of the page, set up your analysis session:

  * **Select Modules:** Check the boxes for the analyses you want to perform (e.g., "Tune Wastegate (WG)").
  * **Select Firmware:** Choose your firmware from the list (S50, A05, etc.). This automatically loads the correct definition file. If your firmware isn't listed, select `Other`.
  * **Adjust Module Settings:** Configure specific options for the selected modules, such as "Use SWG Logic" for wastegate tuning or the target "Ignition Map Selection" for knock analysis.

**2. Upload Your Files**

In the main area of the page, upload the required files:

  * **.bin file:** Your current tune file.
  * **.csv log file(s):** You can upload one or more data logs. The tool will combine them for the analysis.
  * **.xdf file:** Required only if you selected 'Other' firmware in the sidebar.

**3. Run the Analysis**

Click the big "**üöÄ Run YAKtuner Analysis**" button to start the process.

**4. Map Log Variables (If Prompted)**

The first time you run the tool, or if your log headers are different from what the tool expects, YAKtuner may ask for your help.

  * A prompt will appear asking you to match a required variable (e.g., "Engine RPM") to a column from your log file.
  * Simply select the correct column from the dropdown menu and click "Confirm Mapping".
  * The tool will do this for each variable it can't find. Once done, the analysis will proceed automatically.

**5. Review Your Results**

The results for each module will appear in expandable sections.

  * Inside each section, you'll find tabs for **Recommended Tables**, data plots like **Scatter Plots**, and other relevant information.
  * Cells in the recommended tables are highlighted to show where changes have been made compared to your original tune:
      * \<span style="color:green;"\>Green background\</span\> indicates an increased value.
      * \<span style="color:red;"\>Red background\</span\> indicates a decreased value.
