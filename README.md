# ☁️ YAKtuner Online

Welcome to YAKtuner Online, a web-based application designed to analyze engine data logs and provide recommended adjustments for your vehicle's tune. This tool automates complex analysis for various tuning parameters, helping you refine your tune based on real-world data.

### Key Features

  * **Wastegate (WG) Tuning:** Analyzes wastegate duty cycle (WGDC), boost pressure, and IAT compensation to recommend precise adjustments for your base tables. It supports both standard and SWG (Simplified Wastegate) logic to adapt to your specific setup.

  * **Mass Airflow (MAF) & Fuel Factor (MFF) Tuning:**
    * **MAF Tuning:** Corrects the MAF scaling tables by analyzing short-term and long-term fuel trims (STFT/LTFT) during closed-loop operation. This ensures the ECU's air mass measurement is accurate.
    * **MFF Tuning:** Adjusts the multiplicative fuel factor tables based on fuel trims to fine-tune fuel delivery.
    * **Two-Stage MAF+MFF Analysis:** When both MAF and MFF tuning are selected, YAKtuner performs a sequential, two-stage analysis. First, it calculates the recommended MAF corrections. Then, it simulates the impact of those MAF changes on fueling and uses the *corrected* data to perform a more accurate MFF analysis. This ensures that MFF adjustments aren't skewed by an uncalibrated MAF sensor.

  * **Ignition (KNK) Tuning:** Detects knock events across all cylinders from your logs. It then recommends specific ignition timing corrections for your selected base ignition map to improve safety and performance.

  * **Low-Pressure Fuel Pump (LPFP) Tuning:** Analyzes the LPFP's duty cycle and pressure to recommend adjustments, ensuring your fuel system can keep up with demand.

  * **TTA/ATT Consistency Check:** Verifies that your Torque-to-Air (TTA) and Air-to-Torque (ATT) tables are consistent with each other. It calculates the expected torque based on the TTA table and highlights any significant deviations (>5%) from your actual ATT table, helping you catch critical inconsistencies in your torque model.

  * **Interactive Log Variable Mapping:** A smart system that automatically finds the data it needs from your logs. If it's unsure about a variable, it will simply ask you to match it to the correct column from your log file.

  * **Built-in Error Reporting:** If the app encounters a problem, you can easily send a report directly to the developer to help improve the tool.

### How to Use

Follow these steps to get your recommended tune adjustments.

**1. Configure Settings (Sidebar)**

On the left side of the page, set up your analysis session:

  * **Select Modules:** Check the boxes for the analyses you want to perform (e.g., "Tune Wastegate (WG)", "TTA/ATT Consistency Check").
  * **Select Firmware:** Choose your firmware from the list (S50, A05, etc.). This automatically loads the correct definition file. If your firmware isn't listed, select `Other`.
  * **Adjust Module Settings:** Configure specific options for the selected modules, such as "Use SWG Logic" for wastegate tuning or the target "Ignition Map Selection" for knock analysis.

**2. Upload Your Files**

In the main area of the page, upload the required files:

  * **.bin file:** Your current tune file.
  * **.csv log file(s):** You can upload one or more data logs. The tool will combine them for the analysis.
  * **.xdf file:** Required only if you selected 'Other' firmware in the sidebar.

**3. Run the Analysis**

Click the big "**🚀 Run YAKtuner Analysis**" button to start the process.

**4. Map Log Variables (If Prompted)**

The first time you run the tool, or if your log headers are different from what the tool expects, YAKtuner may ask for your help.

  * A prompt will appear asking you to match a required variable (e.g., "Engine RPM") to a column from your log file.
  * Simply select the correct column from the dropdown menu and click "Confirm Mapping".
  * The tool will do this for each variable it can't find. Once done, the analysis will proceed automatically.

**5. Review Your Results**

The results for each module will appear in expandable sections.

  * Inside each section, you'll find tabs for **Recommended Tables**, data plots like **Scatter Plots**, and other relevant information.
  * Cells in the recommended tables are highlighted to show where changes have been made compared to your original tune:
      * \<span style="color:green;"\>Green background\</span\> indicates an increased value.
      * \<span style="color:red;"\>Red background\</span\> indicates a decreased value.
