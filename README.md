# YakWG
----
## What's it do?
Opens logs and bins. Suggests tune changes for WG, MAF and IGN.

----

## Required PIDS
In "PID LISTS" folder. Only PUT_I_INHIBIT is optional, all others are required for the respective tuning function (i.e. WG requires all the pids in WG, but not those in MAF)

----

## Installation
Install by opening the .exe from the releases folder. Alternatively you could copy the "/YAKtuner/for_redistribution_files_only" contents and run, but you must have Matlab2022b runtime environment installed as well.
